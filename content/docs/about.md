# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation of **Bestia**, the free and open-source MMORPG built on a Kotlin and Java backend. Bestia is released under the **GPL v3.0 license**, ensuring that anyone can contribute, modify, and expand upon the game freely.

Bestia is a persistent online game that evolved from a browser-based prototype into a fully-fledged MMORPG. The project aims to provide a deep and engaging game world with real-time mechanics, strategic encounters, and a player-driven environment.

This documentation serves as a guide for developers, contributors, and enthusiasts who wish to understand, modify, or expand Bestia. Whether you're interested in game design, client development, or server-side mechanics, you'll find everything you need to get started here.

## Repository Structure and Dependencies

Bestia is a multi-repository project with dependencies between different components. Understanding these relationships is essential for setting up the development environment.

The core repositories include:

- **`bestia-behemoth`** â€“ The server-side implementation, written in Kotlin and Java. This repository also contains the **ProtoBuf message definitions**, which serve as the communication protocol between the server and the client.
- **`bestia-entity-plugin`** â€“ A plugin for the **Godot Engine**, generated from the ProtoBuf definitions. This plugin is required for the **`bestia-client`** to function properly.
- **`bestia-client`** â€“ The game client, built in **Godot Engine**, using the **bestia-entity-plugin** for interacting with the server.

While the **server** (`bestia-behemoth`) can be built independently, the **client** (`bestia-client`) requires the **entity plugin**, which in turn depends on the server's ProtoBuf definitions. The following diagram illustrates this dependency structure:

## Getting Started

The documentation is divided into three main sections to guide contributors based on their area of interest:

1. **Game Design** â€“ Covers the core mechanics, balance, and world-building aspects of Bestia.
2. **Client Documentation** â€“ Focuses on setting up, developing, and modifying the game client in Godot.
3. **Server Documentation** â€“ Provides insights into the server architecture, database management, and networking protocols.

By following the provided guidelines, developers, artists, and game designers can easily contribute to Bestiaâ€”whether through programming, artwork, or scripting.

If youâ€™re new to the project, start with the **Getting Started** section relevant to your area of interest and explore the development workflows. Welcome aboard! ðŸš€

# History of Bestia

The origins of *Bestia* trace back many years. Initially, it was conceived as a browser-based game inspired by [OGame](https://ogame.de/). The goal was to create an engaging experience that would encourage participation on a high school webpage. However, the game was never fully completed before its intended audience graduated, leaving the project in an unfinished state.

In its early form, *Bestia* was heavily influenced by [PokÃ©mon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon). Players navigated the world using a separate, miniaturized map reminiscent of early *Final Fantasy* games. Traveling to a location took several hours, during which players could trigger encounters with wild *Bestia*. These battles followed a turn-based system. Once inside a location, movement was handled in real timeâ€”but instead of direct character control, players would click on a destination, and their avatar would automatically move there if a valid path existed.

By 2015, the limitations of a 2D browser-based environment and a non-persistent server became increasingly restrictive. As a result, development shifted toward a persistent, continuously running backend service written in Java. This transition allowed for a much richer simulation of the game worldâ€”something inherently difficult to achieve with PHP. However, designing the server architecture proved to be a long and iterative process, undergoing multiple revisions over the years.

This shift also introduced new challenges, particularly in content creation. Unlike a simple browser game, a fully persistent MMORPG required vastly different development pipelinesâ€”an especially demanding task for a solo developer with a background primarily in server architecture.

Around 2020, the free and open-source engine [Godot](https://godotengine.org/) was adopted as part of the tech stack. Its open-source nature made it possible to modify and extend the engine as needed, particularly to support the game's networked server connection. This integration marked a significant step in *Bestiaâ€™s* evolution, paving the way for a more sophisticated and immersive gaming experience.
