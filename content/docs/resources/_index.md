# Development Resources

Here you find helpful links and general guidelines how the look and feel should be from a User Experience point of view.

## Artwork and Design

The general art style will be comic like as for example [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com). This helps the game to get fast assets as its easier then archiving foto-realism and also these styles are more timeless. The assets should be in a low poly style to also ease up development and to help to get a more "timeless" look and feel.

## UI Design

Currently no final UI Design was found. Feel free to contribute!

## Logos

The Bestia logo is done by the font [Long Shot](https://www.dafont.com/de/font-comment.php?file=long_shot&text=Bestia&back=theme)

## Fonts

The fonts should be cleanly readable and only two should be used, one for normal text and another one for more prominent headers:

* The main font for text is [Open Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Open+Sans)
* The header font is [Proza Libre](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Proza+Libre)

There is one Bitmap font for certain ingame usages like damage popups or small item number counts is

* [NES Cyrillic by xbost](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/gallery/?id=234), Public Domain

## Links

Every game needs a good amount of artwork and assets. During development a few pages stood out where to find helpful resources, below is a list of very good and mostly free game assets sources.

> If you want to integrate new assets into Bestia it is important to chose some with an appropriate licence. Since the game itself and currently the assets are released under a free licence the artwork licence must at least allow the bundling and sharing. [Creative Commons 0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/deed.de) or Public Domain is preferred.

* [Bitmap Fonts](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/) (most of them Public Domain). Has a nice gallery of bitmap fonts freely available.
* [Time Fantasy](http://www.timefantasy.net/) A real nice asset of compatible tilesets and sprites for RPG style games. Mostly they are free.
* [Game-Icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) A lot of usable icons with a CC BY 3.0 licence.
* [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/assets) Big chunk of assets some of them free to use.
* [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets) A lot of nice game assets. Some are free, and some can be bought for a few Dollars.
