# Artificial Intelligence

The AI system in Bestia will set new standards. Bestias and NPCs alike should be able to create long-term plans,
so-called game plans or GPs for short. They then follow this strategy until observations or influences from the
game world force them to abandon this plan or the plan is fulfilled.

Bestias look for ways to get the highest possible inner happiness. They must sleep, eat and feel attracted to mana
currents. Of course they try to avoid threats and protect their health. Here some subtypes differ from each other.
Some tend to be aggressive and actively attack players and other Bestias, while others are shy and flee quickly.
But there can also be representatives who are, as you would say, "stupid" and will attack players to death as soon as
they come into sight.

Decisions should be made on the basis of knowledge. A sensory simulation should be used to understand the world and
make decisions based on it.

The basic AI forms should be assignable via shortcut in the Mob table (and for NPCs in the Map Editor). For bosses or
special bestias, however, scripts should be able to be stored to enable target-oriented behavior.
