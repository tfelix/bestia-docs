# Introduction

Welcome to the official documentation of **Bestia**, the free and open-source MMORPG built on a Kotlin and Java backend. Bestia is released under the **GPL v3.0 license**, ensuring that anyone can contribute, modify, and expand upon the game freely.

Bestia is a persistent online game that evolved from a browser-based prototype into a fully-fledged MMORPG. The project aims to provide a deep and engaging game world with real-time mechanics, strategic encounters, and a player-driven environment.

This documentation serves as a guide for developers, contributors, and enthusiasts who wish to understand, modify, or expand Bestia. Whether you're interested in game design, client development, or server-side mechanics, you'll find everything you need to get started here.

## Repository Structure and Dependencies

Bestia is a multi-repository project with dependencies between different components. Understanding these relationships is essential for setting up the development environment.

The core repositories include:

- **`bestia-behemoth`** â€“ The server-side implementation, written in Kotlin and Java. This repository also contains the **ProtoBuf message definitions**, which serve as the communication protocol between the server and the client.
- **`bestia-entity-plugin`** â€“ A plugin for the **Godot Engine**, generated from the ProtoBuf definitions. This plugin is required for the **`bestia-client`** to function properly.
- **`bestia-client`** â€“ The game client, built in **Godot Engine**, using the **bestia-entity-plugin** for interacting with the server.

While the **server** (`bestia-behemoth`) can be built independently, the **client** (`bestia-client`) requires the **entity plugin**, which in turn depends on the server's ProtoBuf definitions. The following diagram illustrates this dependency structure:

  zone[bestia-behemoth] -- ProtoBuf messages --> plugin[bestia-entity-plugin]
  voxel[Voxel Plugin] -- required --> godot[Godot Engine]
  plugin -- required --> godot
  godot -- required --> client[bestia-client]

## Getting Started

The documentation is divided into three main sections to guide contributors based on their area of interest:

1. **Game Design** â€“ Covers the core mechanics, balance, and world-building aspects of Bestia.
2. **Client Documentation** â€“ Focuses on setting up, developing, and modifying the game client in Godot.
3. **Server Documentation** â€“ Provides insights into the server architecture, database management, and networking protocols.

By following the provided guidelines, developers, artists, and game designers can easily contribute to Bestiaâ€”whether through programming, artwork, or scripting.

If youâ€™re new to the project, start with the **Getting Started** section relevant to your area of interest and explore the development workflows. Welcome aboard! ðŸš€
