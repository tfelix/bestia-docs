# Archivements

If a player manages to archive a certain goal then he will be awarded an archivement. These archivements are listed ingame
so the player can view them. It is also possible for other players to access the players archivements.

There are archivements which are unique to a single world and other which every player can reach for his own. World archivements
are saved with the world they were acquired and are reset (they can be re-acuired by another player if the world is re-created).
The date + the name of the world in which the success was achieved always remains in the history for a player.
