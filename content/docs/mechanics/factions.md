In each Bestia world incarnation, there are three factions to which the Bestia master can belong. Each faction has its own unique goals and beliefs.

The factions are designed to create dynamic interactions among players. While players can generally engage in combat with each other at any time, the primary rivalries should occur between these factions. Game mechanics should provide each faction with additional bonuses for collaborative efforts, encouraging active participation and strategic gameplay.

Players can invest in their faction's citadel. Only one citadel can exist at a time, but players are free to build as many temples as they wish, where they can access their faction's services. Notably, some achievements by the factions will persist even when the world is replaced by a new one, helping players retain their wealth during [world destruction](/docs/mechanics/doomsday) events.

Players should be able to change factions, but this will come with a challenging task and various disadvantages.

# The Chaos

The Chaos seeks to hasten the world's destruction, believing that the influx of mana is the inevitable fate of every world. They aim to amass mana, open rifts to remote legions, and reshape the world in their twisted image until it is consumed by flames.

The Chaos faction members are experts in improving their mana flow, increasing their mana values and casting powerfull spells and rituals that can devestate and corrupt whole areas of the world.

# The Order

The Order is the preserving faction. They believe in stability and strive to halt the ongoing destruction of the worlds. As they understand the mana flux and rifts destabilize the world. The see the appearence of Bestia as one part of the downfall of the world.

Their ultimate goal is to end the influx of mana. To this end, they research spells to remove and control mana influx and rifts and in general despell mana and supressive rituals to counter magic and Bestia.

# The Harmony

The Harmony seeks to balance the forces of chaos and order. They believe that neither destruction nor preservation alone can sustain the world. Instead, they aim to harness the power of mana to create a harmonious equilibrium. Their goal is to research spells and devices that can stabilize the world without eliminating the mana influx entirely.

Players in this faction must work to maintain a delicate balance, ensuring that neither chaos nor order gains too much control. The faction has great mechanics and inventors building devices to measure the state of the world and help with exploration. Because only knowledge can lead to harmony.

# Faction Goals

Land masses can fall under the influence of a particular faction, attracting Bestias friendly to that faction's members. Special resources may be generated, or more mana rifts may open, increasing the mana within the region. Additionally, the dominant faction can receive a global bonus.

When a world is created, it is predetermined when it should end to last for `x` days (world ending events are timed when the world is created). If **The Chaos** manages to destroy a world in 80% of this timespan, it is considered a faction advantage of `20%` when the next world is incarnated. Similarly, if **The Order** keeps a world alive for `130%` of its estimated time, their advantage is `30%`. For The Harmony, maintaining a balanced state for an extended period would also grant them a unique advantage. After 60% of the worlds expected live span is over if neither influence of either faction is bigger than 60% it gives them for every day of balance one more influence point for the next world. Since this is easier to reach than the other faction goals their advantage in the next world incarnation is not so impactful.

When the world is destroyed 5 advantage points go to the faction with the biggest sphere of influence, and 3 to the ones who sacrificed/used the most resources in their temples.

## Faction Advantages

When a world is created and in the previous incarnation a faction earned faction advantage points, they get a buff for the whole next world duration.

## Switching a Faction

A player can get expelled from a faction by a powerfull spell `Banished from the Citadel`. However this spell first must be found as a drop on a spell scroll, it can not be memorized and if it is applied to the player, the player will lose `20%` of his levels rounded up (e.g. a Lv. 67 master will drop to Lv. 54). And endure a debuff which will reduce his damage, mana and health by `10%` for the next 15 [bestia days](/docs/mechanics/environment/#in-game-time).
It is a very severe and faction switches should be fairly rare, especially for high level players.

### Citadels and Temples

Each faction build and maintain a citadel or temple in which it can research powerful spells and devices that players can learn or access to achieve their goals.
If magic rituals are perfomed in those headquarters all players belonging to this faction can receive a global buff.
