Status Values are the base values from which the basics for all ingame calculations are performed.
There are five main types of status values: **Status Values**, **Base Values (BV)**, **Individual Values (IV)**, **Effort Value (EV)** and **Status Based Values (SBV)**.

The status value is calculated from the **base value** and the **individual value**. The base value is a specialized base value static for every bestia. The **IV** are determined when a bestia is caught and range from 0-100. The effort value is determined by the player and can be freely choose when a level up happens.

**Status Based Values (SBV)** are values which are important for damage calculation but are just derived from status values.

# Status Values

The sophisticated status system describes the current state of an bestia (or simply any living entity) and does not strictly apply only to biological entities. The status system is important to calculate all battle related effects in the game.

Status values are calculated like:

```kotlin
statusValue = (baseValue + individualValue) * level / 100 + effortValue
```

## Intelligence (INT)

* Main influence value for magic domain related effects and power/damage of magic based attacks and skills.
* Increases the duration of magical effects from the player (buffs, skills, etc)
* Increases the total amount of available mana

## Willpower (WIL)

* Increases resistance against enemy spells and magic effects.
* Increases mana regeneration over time
* Increases the duration of magic effects from the player
* Reduces cast duration of spells
* Increases slightly the stamina regeneration
* Increases slightly the total amount of stamina
* Slightly increases resistance against temperature

## Strength (STR)

* Increases damage of physical attacks (and slightly the damage of distance attacks)
* Increases carry capacity
* Increases the maximum HP amount slightly
* Increases the maximum stamina amount slightly

## Vitality (VIT)

* Reduces the damage of physical attacks
* Increases the HP regeneration over time
* Increases the maximum amount of HP
* Increases the stamina regeneration
* Increases the maximim amount of stamina
* Increases resistence against temperature

## Dexterity (DEX)

* Increases the hitchance of physical based attacks
* Increases the probability of a critical hit
* Increases the damage of a distance attack
* Increases upgrade chance of items and equipment by 1% ever 10 DEX.

## Agility (AGI)

* Increases the attack rate
* Increases the walking speed
* Increases the dodge chance (flee rate) for physical attacks (melee and distance)

# Status Based Values

These values are highly relevant for battle calculations. The values are derived from the status values.

## Health

HP is the life energy of a Bestia or entity. If the HP reaches 0 the Bestia is killed

```kotlin
HP = floor(((15 + (baseValueHP * 2 + ivHp) * level / 100 + level) * (1 + VIT * 0.01) + HPModSum) * HPMod%)
```

## Mana

Mana is the energy needed to cast spells or abilities. The more mana the Bestia has the more or bigger spells she can cast

```kotlin
MANA = floor(((25 + (baseValueMana * 2 + ivMana) * level / 100 + level) * (1 + INT * 0.01) + ManaModSum) * ManaMod%)
```

## Stamina (STA)

Stamina is the third value and is used as a means to measure bestia "exhaustion". It is usually not really super important but the player should be reminded to rest the Bestia from time to time.

* If stamina drops to low the walkspeed of the Bestia decreases
  * From 30% stamina to 0% stamina the walkspeed linearly decreases by 50%.
* A stamina below 10% stops the mana and HP generation
* A stamina below 5% leads to a slow HP drop over time
  * 0.3% of max HP loss every tick (leads to death in about 8h real time)
* Stamina can be regenerated by resting in a safe spot or by using items/meals.

## HIT

Calculates the chance of hitting an enemy.

```kotlin
HIT = 175 + BaseLv + DEX + floor(WIL ÷ 3) + Bonus
```

The chance to land a hit is calculated as `(AttackerHit - DefenderFlee)%`. The chance can not be below 5%.

## FLEE

This is the dodge rate of attacks.

```kotlin
FLEE = 100 + BaseLv + AGI + Floor(LUK ÷ 5) + Bonus
```

## CRIT

The Critical Hit rating, which increases damage by (40 + CRIT)%. Offensive attacks do not take CRIT into account except for a few exceptions. Critical Hit also ignores Flee rate but not DEF. Critical Hit Rate is doubled when wielding a Katar type weapon. Critical Hit rate is reduced based on the enemy's Critical Hit Shield.

```kotlin
CRIT = WIL ÷ 3 + Bonus
```

* Critical damage always goes with the highest weapon level variance

## Soft DEF

TBD

## Soft MDEF

Soft magic defense, also known as "INT" magic defense, reduces incoming magic damage directly.

```kotlin
SoftMDEF = (floor(INT + (VIT / 5) + (DEX / 5) + (BaseLv / 4)) + SoftMdefModAdditive) × SoftMdefMod%
```

## Attack Speed - ASPD

The attack speed describes how quick basic attacks can be performed. Its dependent on the following criteria:

* The player's class.
* The player's weapon type.
* Increasing AGI to gain higher Attack Speed. (DEX provides negligible Attack Speed increases)
* Wearing a shield decreases Attack Speed and is more dramatic at higher base Attack Speeds.
* Some items, skills and equipments can either increase or decrease Attack Speed.
* Equipping a shield reduces ASPD by 7.

```kotlin
StartASPD = 150
EquipASPD % = [ { 195 − BaseASPD } × EquipASPDMod ]
BaseASPD = [ 200 − { 200 − [StartASPD + ShieldPenalty + √(AGI × 10 + DEX × 0.2) ] } × { 1 − PotionASPDMod − SkillASPDMod } ]
FinalASPD = BaseASPD * EquipASPD%  + EquipASPDFixed
```

The hits per second are calculated like this:

```kotlin
Hit/s = 1000 / ((200 - ASPD) * 10 + 70)
```

## Attack - ATK

This is derived from the player's Base Level, STR, DEX, and WIL. This is always considered as Neutral property.

```kotlin
ATK = (BaseLevel ÷ 4) + STR + (DEX ÷ 5) + (WIL ÷ 3)
```

when using ranged weapons the formula becomes:

```kotlin
ATK = (BaseLevel ÷ 4) + DEX + (STR ÷ 5) + (WIL ÷ 3)
```

### Weapon Attack - WATK

This is derived from a player's equiped weapon and STR or DEX depending on your weapon type. Variance, StatBonus, and OverUpgradeBonus is not shown in the Status Window.

```kotlin
WATK = (BaseWeaponDamage + Variance + StatBonus + RefinementBonus + OverUpgradeBonus) × SizePenalty
```

## Magic Attack - MATK

# Effort Values

Upon level up of a Bestia or Master it gains **Gain Points** which the player is free to distribute into his **Effort Values**
to any of the status values. One point into the effort value will directly add 1 point to the respective Status Value.

Once spend these points are fixed and can not re-distributed anymore (there might be quests or NPC which
are able to reset these values in a certain amount).

The gain points for a level up is calculated like this:

```kotlin
effGain = 5 + floor(reachedLevel / 2)
```

The amount of Gain Points the player needs to spend in order to rise a Effort Value is calculated like:

```kotlin
effGainNeeded = max(1, (nextEffValue / 3)
```

# Individual Values

The individual value **IVs** are generated when the Bestia spawns and makes this somewhat random. Its possible to find better or worst Bestia. By [breeding Bestia](/docs/mechanics/bestia#breeding) this IVs are subject to manipulation by the player and it is possible to make stronger Bestia in a controlled way. A bestia master always has IVs of 50 for every stat.

# Base Values

Every Bestia has Base Values upon which the status values are calculated. With setting these values some baseline for status values can be controlled from the designer. Every status has its designated base value.

For other non Bestia based entities like items or buildings etc. base values are usually generated via a ruleset and are assigned in a static matter.
