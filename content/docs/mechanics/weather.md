# Weather

The weather system in Bestia plays a crucial role. It also affects the visibility and also the behavior of the NPC and
mobs. Depending on the weather the NPCs and the player character will need a improved shelter or equipment to avoid a
loss of stamina.

The weather influences the temperature which will in turn decide if and how much stamina a entity regenerates or loses.

## Rain

A in strength controllable rain effect should overlay the entire viewport. The rain blowing direction should correlate
with the wind direction (which will be more or less random). During rain start the ground will show a watering effect.
This means that reflecting poodles of water will start to form as well as circular raindrops which will darkening the ground.

## Fog

Clouds of fog will move slowly over the map. And the sight of the entities is reduced.

## Sun

The light will bleach out the colors and form a more lighter environment.

## Night

During the traversal from day to night the overall color should be color corrected to simulate the rising or setting
sun as well as night times (color reduction). During night time the player will need light sources in order to improve
the visibility of enemies or terrain. There will be certain items (e.g. torches, candles etc.) as well as spells to
make light.
