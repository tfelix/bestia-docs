# Environment

Bestia uses a sophisticated temperature and environment system to drive weather simulation and the effects on the players environment.

These simulations should be based on certain basic values which are determined location-dependent, but can be changed by interaction with the players. Also natural changes through the world (seasons) should lead to an adjustment of these values.
Due to the changes of the environmental values tiles have to be adapted to the world itself. These have to be adjusted anyway if they should change due to other local effects like fire or mining. The client must be informed about adjusted tiles.

> persisted in their account data to keep a record.

## Temperature

Each Bestia has a certain sweet spot of tolerable temperature. There are several kind of base temperature ranges in
which Bestia thrive:

| Temperature Kind   | Base Temperature Range [Â°C] |
| ------------------ | --------------------------: |
| Low Temperature    |                    -20 - 15 |
| Medium Temperature |                     10 - 30 |
| High Temperature   |                     25 - 45 |

`Vitality` and `Willpower` increases resistenace against the temperatures. Specialized equipments or status effects can also
affect temperature resistence.

The formular is as follows:

{{< katex >}}
\begin{aligned}
   T_{increase} &= \sqrt{\text{VIT}} / 2\\
   T_{increase}  &= \sqrt{\text{WILL}} / 4\\
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

For items and structures these calculation is a bit different. Usually these items have some threshold above or under which they will
start to malfunction or perhaps even catch fire.

## Weather

The weather system in Bestia plays a crucial role. It also affects the visibility and also the behavior of the NPC and
mobs. Depending on the weather the NPCs and the player character will need a improved shelter or equipment to avoid a
loss of stamina.

The weather influences also the temperature which will in turn decide if and how much stamina a entity regenerates or loses.

The weather will also play a role in which crops and plants grow. If the player decided to plant salad in the desert this won't work quite well.

## Rain

A in strength controllable rain effect should overlay the entire viewport. The rain blowing direction should correlate
with the wind direction (which will be more or less random). During rain the ground will show a wet effect and view distance is
reduced. It also reduces the effectiveness of fires and might extingush them. Fire attacks will lose certain strengths in a very wet environment (like burning effects won't last very long).

## Fog

Clouds of fog will move slowly over the map. And the sight of the AI entities is reduced. Its will also get harder for a player to see.

## Night

During night time the player will need light sources in order to improve
the visibility of enemies or terrain. There will be certain items (e.g. torches, candles etc.) as well as spells to
make light.

## Ingame Time

The time in the Bestia game is faster then the real world time. When we refer to the faster in-game time we will call it
**bestia time**, if we refer to the normal time we call it **real time**.

Changing seasons should lead to an impression of the changeability of the world. You have to adapt to a periodically
changing environment. Things that work in summer may not be possible in winter. But so that the players don't have
to wait for a real year, time in Bestia flies faster.

The bestia time starts at the creation of the bestia world. It is basically three times faster then the usual time.
This means that the normal bestia day has 8 hours in real time.

This means that the bestia month has 10 days in real time and an bestia year is 4 month in real time.

* Bestia year: 4 months
* Bestia seasion: summer, winter, fall, spring: each 1 month
* Bestia day: 8 hours

### Time Calculation

The easiest way to calculate the time in the Bestia world is the following:

{{< katex >}}
\begin{aligned}
   btime &= time_{real} / 3 \\
   btime_{hours} &= btime / 3600\\
   btime_{days} &= btime_{hours} / 24\\
   btime_{months} &= btime_{days} / 30\\
   btime_{years} &= btime_{years} / 12
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

This allows the player to see multiple day-night cycles on the same day while allowing him to play for a considerable
time so he can actually do something meaningful until the sun rises again.

> If it turns out that the night period is too annyoing for the players because
> of the limited amount of gameplay then the night might get shortened.

This caluclation results in the following example timespans:

| Bestia Time | Real Time |
| ----------- | --------- |
| 3 h         | 1 h       |
| 12 d        | 4 d       |
| 1 yr        | 4 mon     |
