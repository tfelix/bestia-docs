# <i class="fas fa-users"></i> The Cults

In each Bestia World there are 2-3 cults to which the Bestia summoners can belong. When creating the world, the existing
cults are chosen randomly. At least one cult should long for the destruction of the world, one should prevent it. Optionally
there are some neutral cults that pursue their own goals which do not deal with the destruction of the world. These
cults should not exist in every world iteration.

The cults are ultimately a faction. The goal is to be able to play these factions among themselves. Usually players can
fight against each other at any time, but the rivalries should take place between the cults. To this end, game mechanics
must be established that in a certain way grant the individual cults an additional bonus in a collaborative approach and
thus offer playful incentives to actively intervene in the game.

Players should be able to change cults. However, this will be sanctioned with a difficult task and will be associated
with various disadvantages.

## Cult Advantages

It would be conceivable that special land areas fall under the influence of a certain cult. This would attract certain
Bestias that are friendly to the cult members. Special resources are generated or more Mana rifts are opened and the
Mana within the country increases there. Furthermore, the prevailing faction can be rewarded with a global bonus.
Additional EXP bonuses would be conceivable.
