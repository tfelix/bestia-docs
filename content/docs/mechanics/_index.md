# Game Design Overview

**Bestia** is built on an open-world, emergent gameplay philosophy, allowing players to shape their own experiences while staying true to the game's core manifesto. The world is dynamic, driven by player actions and ever-evolving systems that create a deep, immersive environment.

This document details the **key game mechanics and design principles**, providing concrete specifications to guide implementation. While the manifesto sets broad ideological guidelines, this section focuses on specific gameplay features, ensuring clarity for both development and expansion.

At the heart of the game is a **world torn apart** by a cataclysmic event known as the **Rift Event**. Magic surged uncontrollably, merging two realities and warping their physical properties—leading to widespread devastation. The player, a survivor of this catastrophe, is thrust into a **harsh new world**, forced to adapt, explore, and rebuild.

Survival is just the beginning. Players will gather resources, forge alliances and rivalries, and ultimately shape the fate of the world. The theme of **destruction and rebirth** runs throughout the game, with players aligning themselves with different **factions**—some seeking to hasten the world’s demise, others striving to prevent further chaos (see [The Factions](/docs/mechanics/factions) for more details).

This document will continue to evolve, expanding on these foundations and refining the game’s mechanics as development progresses.

**Note**

Try to conform to the core concepts as close as possible when you want to contribute content! This makes sure your changes are quickly merged.

## Consistent Fantasy Simulation

Our goal is to create an immersive world where players can forge their own stories. To achieve this, we must provide an environment that encourages exploration and creativity. The game should motivate players to solve problems using their ingenuity rather than relying on brute force. Every element within the world should be explainable through in-universe theories and follow logical patterns.

To maintain immersion, there should be no magical user interfaces that teleport players to the next dungeon. Instead, players should be encouraged to find solutions themselves, perhaps by seeking help from other character classes capable of opening portals. Interaction between players is highly encouraged to overcome challenges.

## A Single Universe

Just as we all inhabit the same planet, our game should exist within a single, unified world. Multiple servers can fragment the community, whereas a single universe fosters interaction and cohesion. While technically challenging, connecting all players through a common game world is a goal worth pursuing to build a stronger, more interconnected community.

## Stable Mechanics

In many modern games, players are kept engaged through constant changes in game mechanics. However, this approach can be frustrating for players who return after a long absence, as they must relearn mechanics that have changed. Our game will strive to maintain stable and consistent gameplay mechanics. Once established, these mechanics will be preserved to ensure a smooth and enjoyable experience for all players, minimizing the need for constant relearning.

**Note**

Bugs and balancing problems are still subject to a fix of course.

## Encouraging Social Interaction

Many game mechanics should require interaction with other players. Rituals that need multiple players, or even the cooperation of various character classes, should be the norm rather than the exception. While solo players should still enjoy the game, the full potential of this MMORPG can only be experienced through social interaction. This approach fosters a sense of community and strengthens players' bonds with the game.

## Advanced Crafting

In keeping with our commitment to fantasy realism, items are typically not obtained by defeating monsters. Instead, they must be crafted. Raw materials are found throughout the world, and almost all equipment is either manufactured by players or purchased from NPCs. NPC vendors have limited stock, which must be replenished and delivered, leading to the establishment of trade routes. Prices are determined by supply and demand, with NPCs aiming to maximize their profits. Players should be able to easily participate in this economic cycle as both producers and consumers.

For more details on professions, refer to the [Skills and Attacks](/mechanics/skills) section.

## Modern Artificial Intelligence

The game features a cutting-edge, powerful AI that brings the world and its inhabitants to life. NPCs follow daily routines and pursue their own goals, allowing players to observe patterns and interact with them. NPCs react to player actions and can travel long distances, making them unavailable for periods. This dynamic behavior enhances the game's immersion and realism.

## Rich and Immersive History

The game's story and history should be detailed and immersive, with a touch of quirky, nerdy humor. While the narrative should be engaging, it must also be flexible enough to allow for pre-computed elements when the world is generated. Character development and in-game experiences should be tied to specific stories or quests, discouraging gameplay choices made solely through UI interactions.

## Meeting Real-World Expectations

The game environment should align with real-world expectations. For example, if a door can be opened by destroying it in the real world, the same should apply in the game. This principle allows players to think creatively and find innovative solutions to in-game problems, enhancing their overall experience.
