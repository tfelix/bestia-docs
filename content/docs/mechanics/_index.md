# Game Design Guidelines

The game offers several main aspects of gameplay that the player can perceive, taking into account the always valid
manifesto statements. In addition, the concept of the open world should open up an emergent game principle.

Here concrete realizations of central game elements are described. Contrary to the rough guidelines of the manifesto,
the discussion and description of a concrete game feature is already at stake here. The specification of the respective
feature should be described as exactly as possible in order to make an easy implementation possible. The list will be
constantly updated and extended.

This document describes the core thoughts and principals under which all game design choices should be oriented
and challenged.

> It is best practice to stick as close as possible to the design principles described in the [Core Guidelines](/docs/mechanics/core-guidelines)!
