# <i class="fas fa-user"></i> Bestia Master

The intro game tells players how to become a Bestia Master. They came into direct contact with an ephemeral mana crystal
that changed their nature through magic and connected them to the mana currents. They are therefore receptive to the
mana Rivers and are able to communicate with the beings that emerge from this mythical energy: **the Bestias**.

In areas with high mana concentration, so-called mini rift events are formed. At these neuralgic points, Bestia are
materialized and enter the respective worlds.

The attachment to mana also explains why Bestia masters were able to survive the destruction of their world relatively
unscathed and to pass on to the next world.

> Bestia Master enter the current world from another, not further mentioned dimension. During each incarnation
> a name of this world is generated and in each cycle all Bestia Master entering the game will have this world name
> persisted in their account data.
