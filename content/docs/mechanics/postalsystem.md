# Postal System

Based on World of Warcraft, a postal system is to be established. The system should make it possible to send letters,
but above all items and money to other players and places. But unlike most games, it should not be an "out-of-world"
system. It would be conceivable that players would have to organize the system themselves and send Bestia as postmen
to remote locations in Aventerra. This should take the speed out of the game. Arrival will have to be waited longer
and the effort for the players will increase.

It would also be conceivable to have a paid telegram system for players to transport messages with valuable goods
faster and safer (but then costs considerably more gold). It would be very nice to have one or more NPCs to transport
the mail in the game. This could then become a victim of robberies and highwaymen like players themselves. It is just
not sure if the AI is able to perform such tasks reliably.
