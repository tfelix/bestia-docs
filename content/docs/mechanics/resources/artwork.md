# Artwork and Design

The general art style will be comic like as for example [World of Warcraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com). This helps
the game to get fast assets as its easier then archiving foto-realism and also these styles are more timeless.

## UI Design

Currently no final UI Design was found. Feel free to contribute!

## Logos

Currently no final Bestia Logo was found. Feel free to contribute!

## Fonts

Currently the font usage is not finally decided. These are the possible fonts:

* [FaryDust](http://www.dafont.com/de/fairydustb.font?text=Bestia)
* [Conthrax](http://www.dafont.com/de/conthrax.font?l[]=10&l[]=1&text=Bestia)

## Links

Every game needs a good amount of artwork and assets. To make it easier to find and integrate new components some links where assembled.

> If you want to integrate new assets into Bestia it is important to chose some with an appropriate licence. Since the game itself and currently the assets are released under a free licence the artwork licence must at least allow the bundling and sharing. [Creative Commons](https://creativecommons.org/) or Public Domain is preferred.

* [Bitmap Fonts](http://www.pentacom.jp/pentacom/bitfontmaker2/) (most of them Public Domain). Has a nice gallery of bitmap fonts freely available.
* [Time Fantasy](http://www.timefantasy.net/) A real nice asset of compatible tilesets and sprites for RPG style games. Mostly they are free.
* [Game-Icons.net](https://game-icons.net/) A lot of usable icons with a CC BY 3.0 licence.
* [Kenney](http://kenney.nl/assets) Big chunk of assets some of them free to use.
* [itch.io](https://itch.io/game-assets) A lot of nice game assets. Some are free, and some can be bought for a few Dollars.
