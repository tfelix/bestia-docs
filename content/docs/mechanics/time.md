# Bestia Time

The time in the Bestia game is faster then the real world time. When we refer to the faster in-game time we will call it
**bestia time**, if we refer to the normal time we call it **real time**.

Changing seasons should lead to an impression of the changeability of the world. You have to adapt to a periodically
changing environment. Things that work in summer may not be possible in winter. But so that the players don't have
to wait for a real year, time in Bestia flies faster.

The bestia time starts at the creation of the bestia world. It is basically three times faster then the usual time.
This means that the normal bestia day has 8 hours in real time.

This means that the bestia month has 10 days in real time and an bestia year is 4 month in real time.

* Bestia year: 4 months
* Bestia seasion: summer, winter, fall, spring: each 1 month
* Bestia day: 8 hours

## Bestia Time Calculation

The easiest way to calculate the time in the Bestia world is the following:

{{< katex >}}
\begin{aligned}
   btime &= time_{real} / 3 \\
   btime_{hours} &= btime / 3600\\
   btime_{days} &= btime_{hours} / 24\\
   btime_{months} &= btime_{days} / 30\\
   btime_{years} &= btime_{years} / 12
\end{aligned}
{{< /katex >}}

This allows the player to see multiple day-night cycles on the same day while allowing him to play for a considerable
time so he can actually do something meaningful until the sun rises again.

> If it turns out that the night period is too annyoing for the players because
> of the limited amount of gameplay then the night might get shortened.
