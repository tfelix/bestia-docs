# Attacks

The magic and the usage of it plays a crucial role in the Bestia universe. The users should be able to be deeply involved
into magic spell creation and research.

> The words Attacks and Spells are equally used.

The system must allow the user to describe or discover newly innovative ways to combine spells. Yet the research should
be fun and entertaining. Bestias can learn attacks by two means:

1. Level Up - Each Bestia has a internal list of attacks she will learn when gaining levels.
2. Spell Discovery - The player can try to "invent/discover" new attacks which then can be tried to be learned to a Bestia.
   This means 16 attacks until level 70 and about 4 attacks later on.

## Level Up Learning

General rule of thumb is:

1. A Bestia should have about 20 Attacks.
2. 80% of the attacks should be learned from level 1 - 69. The last 20% of the attacks between level 70 - 100.

### Spell Discovery

Spells can be discovered by the player. If he has the skill **Spell Discovery**. The maximum attack learnable by the skill
level is given in the table below.

| Spell Discovery Lv. | max. Attack Level Discoverable |
| ------------------- | -----------------------------: |
| 1                   |                             10 |
| 2                   |                             20 |
| 3                   |                             30 |
| 4                   |                             40 |
| 5                   |                             50 |
| 6                   |                             60 |
| 7                   |                             70 |
| 8                   |                             80 |
| 9                   |                             90 |
| 10                  |                            100 |

To discover a spell an aspect is chosen like 'White Magic', 'Black Magic' or 'Arkane Magic'.

## Spell Enscription

If the player owns the skill [Spell Enscription]([/docs/mechanics/skills/#spell-enscription) he can attach the spell to
scrolls or even to other entities.

After a spell has been materialized and bound to some kind of magic containment it can be used by the owner. Spells of
a higher level are of course far harder to handle. Attaching or handling such spells could produce unwanted side effects
depending on the spell (some spells might create explosions, others might teleport something away or randomly heal
bystanders etc.)

## Spell Attachments

Most if not each entity/object in the game world has slots/events to which spells can be attached to. If such an event
is triggered the effect of the spell is resolved.

## Detection of Magic

The must be a skill which enables the user to detect magic. The detection itself is easier if the spell is more
powerful. However precautions can be used to avoid the spell getting detected. If more than one spell is attached to an
object the less powerful spells are harder to detect.
