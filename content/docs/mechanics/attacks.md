In Bestia, there are two main types of magical actions:

1. **Skills** – Learned by a Bestia Master. Skills have levels and can be upgraded in a skill tree as the Master levels up. These are controlled by the player using skill points.
2. **Attacks** (also called Abilities) – Learned by a Bestia as it levels up, at fixed, predefined levels. These can be battle-related or utility magic.

{{< alert context="info" text="Master skills are based on a skill tree and can be leveled up, while Bestia attacks are learned automatically at designated levels and have a fixed level." />}}

Each skill or attack is characterized by its **level**, **magic school**, and **elemental aspect**.

# How Bestias Learn Attacks

Bestias can learn attacks in two ways:

1. **Level Up** – Each Bestia has an internal list of attacks it will learn as it gains levels. The same attack may be learned at different levels by different Bestias.
2. **Spell Scrolls** – Players can inscribe attacks onto spell scrolls (or find them as loot). These spells can be used directly from the scroll or taught to a Bestia.

General guidelines when Bestia are learning attacks from level ups:

* From Lv. 1–100, a Bestia should learn about 25 attacks.
* Around 20 attacks are learned between Lv. 1–70; the last 5 (most powerful) between Lv. 71–100.

# Magic Schools

All skills and attacks are divided into three schools of magic: **Arcane**, **Black**, and **White Magic**. These schools may affect spell effects, skill improvements, or equipment bonuses.

* **Arcane Magic** - Trickster magic: illusions, utility spells (e.g., generating food or shelter), transmutations, and other unusual effects. Rarely includes damaging spells.
* **Black Magic** - Damaging spells intended to inflict harm, reduce defenses, or apply negative status effects.
* **White Magic** - Healing, buffing, and protection spells. Includes detection and neutralization of magic, as well as all forms of healing and status improvement.

# Attack Enscription

If the player has the skill [Attack Enscription](/docs/mechanics/skills/#attack-enscription), attacks can be inscribed onto scrolls for single-use or to teach other Bestias.

After a spell is materialized and bound to a scroll, it can be used by the owner. High-level spells are harder to handle and may cause side effects (e.g., explosions, random teleportation, or healing bystanders).

| Attack Level | Base Enscription Success |
| ------------ | ------------------------ |
| 1–20         | 100%                     |
| 21–40        | 80%                      |
| 41–60        | 70%                      |
| 61–80        | 60%                      |
| 81–90        | 30%                      |
| 91–100       | 10%                      |
| 101+         | -10%                     |

# Spell Binding

Many entities and objects in the game world have slots and triggers for attaching attacks. With the [Spell Binding](/docs/mechanics/skills/#spell-binding) skill, players can discover these slots and bind spells to entities—useful for traps or intelligence devices. The following are some potential triggers:

* Entity entering or leaving an area
* Trigger on pickup
* Specific entity (friendly or foe)
* Presence of magic
* Weather conditions
* Time
* Spell cast in the vicinity

# Detection of Magic

Detecting enchanted items or traps is possible with the [Detect Magic](/docs/mechanics/skills/#detect-magic) skill. Higher-level spells are easier to detect, but precautions can make detection harder. If multiple spells are attached to an object, weaker spells are more difficult to detect.
