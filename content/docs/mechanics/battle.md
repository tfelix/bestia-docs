# Battle

Basically every entity in the Bestia world can be attacked, damaged and destroyed.

## Death

Players Master can not die directly, they are reborn with a temporary malus.

A killed Bestia or Master loses `1%` of their current experience. The items are automatically protected via a spell
which tries to teleport the items back to a secure storage (but remember: spells can be dispelled!).

If the player activates the so-called **Hard Mode** he gets an experience bonus as well as a loot bonus of `+3%`.
However, if he dies he looses `5%`of his current experience and items are not protected by default with a spell.

In both cases the items suffer a durability penality.

Bestias can be permanently get killed if the killing blow is particularly strong. If s once activated the
**Hard Mode** this process will take one hour real time. This should prevent players from switching the mode on and off
quickly after detecting a dicey situation.
