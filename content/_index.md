## About

**Congratulations!** You just have found the Developer Documentation of the Bestia-Game. Here you find everything from
gamedesign guidlines to engine architecture overview as well as the API documentation to access game resources.

These infos should help you to get kickstarted and join the development. As Bestia is a community driven, open game each
contribution is welcome. With the provided guidelines enthusiasts should very easily be able to create contributions
from artworks to scripts.

> **The game currently transforms into a stand-alone client which is currently not available for testing.**

## Contributing

Contributions to both the game design and the game itself (the client and the server) are very welcome!

You may find a little `Edit this page` link at the bottom of each page. If you want to change some game design
aspects feel free to give it a try!

Inside this game design document you possibly will find certain **Contributing** sections which will give you some
guidelines to follow in order to help to get you changes into the game quickly.

**[Read the Bestia Manifest first](about-manifest.md)** and align your contributions and changes under these central
game guidelines.
