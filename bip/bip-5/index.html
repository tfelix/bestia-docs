<p>A REST interface should be defined to allow the clients to query easily for a translation of ressources. This can either be names, item, descriptions. The system should be fast in order to retrieve the translation resources. There should be some kind of protection so the client can not completely dump all translations from the database in order to extract information from the system. Best would be to check if he is allowed to access this information though this might be too slow for practical purpose.</p>
