<p>BIPs are used to describe some technical details about subsystems which are in use to improve the Bestia game. If they
are in a draft state they are not included into this document but as soon as they are worked out they are included and
are awaiting implementation.</p>
<p>Implementation of a BIP is done in a own branch named after the pattern: feat-bip-N where N is the number of the BIP.</p>
