# Bestia Documentation

[![License: CC0](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-CC0-green)](LICENSE)

> Welcome to the world of Bestia—a MMORPG where exploration, emergent gameplay, and a living, simulated environment await.

This repository is your gateway to the central game design documents and guidelines for the [Bestia Game](https://bestia-game.net). Born as a hobby project and grown into a substantial codebase, Bestia invites curious minds to read, understand, and perhaps even contribute to its ongoing adventure.

Here you'll find everything from game design principles to client and server architecture. Whether you're a seasoned developer or a newcomer eager to explore, this documentation is your starting point.

The latest documentation is always available at [https://docs.bestia-game.net](https://docs.bestia-game.net).

For those interested in the code behind the magic, check out the mono-repository:

* [Behemoth Game Server](https://github.com/tfelix/bestia-behemoth)

## Build

Bestia Docs is powered by [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), the static site generator. Thanks to Hugo module support, setup is now easier than ever—no need to wrangle submodules or extra checkouts.

To build and preview the documentation locally:

```bash
# Install Hugo (see https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/)
# Then, from the repository root:
hugo server -D
```

That's it! Hugo will fetch all required modules automatically. Your local docs will be live and ready for exploration.

The site uses [Lotusdocs for Hugo](https://github.com/colinwilson/lotusdocs), licensed under the MIT License.
