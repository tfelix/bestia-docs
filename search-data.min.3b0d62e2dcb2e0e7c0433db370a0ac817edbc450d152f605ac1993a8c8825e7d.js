(function(){const pages=[{"idx":0,"href":"/docs/mechanics/","title":"Game Design","content":" Game Design The game offers several main aspects of gameplay that the player can perceive, taking into account the always valid manifesto statements. In addition, the concept of the open world should open up an emergent game principle.\nHere concrete realizations of central game elements are described. Contrary to the rough guidelines of the manifesto, the discussion and description of a concrete game feature is already at stake here. The specification of the respective feature should be described as exactly as possible in order to make an easy implementation possible. The list will be constantly updated and extended.\nThis document describes the core thoughts and principals under which all game design choices should be oriented and challenged.\n It is best practice to stick as close as possible to the design principles described in the next section: Core Concepts.\n Core Concepts Consistent Fantasy Simulation We want to tell a story, a story the players forge and form by themselves. We must provide a world, an environment in which this is made possible. The game should motivate the players to explore and test their creativity for solving problems. Nothing frustrates more then to solve riddles only by bruteforcing the answers. All the things inside the world should be explainable by in-universe theories and follow certain logic patterns. There should be no magic User Interface which will teleport the player to the next Dungeon and destroy the immersive fantasy. The player should be motivated to solve this problems by himself maybe by finding a friendly other character class which is able to open portals. Interaction between players is highly encouraged to solve problems.\nA Single Universe We all live on the same planet. So do we really need multiple servers? Multiple servers tear the community apart. Of course it is technically more challenging to connect all players through a common game world. But this challenge has to be met. One community further encourages interaction between the players.\nStable Mechanics In modern games players are kept encouraged by constantly changing the game mechanics. These poor design choices makes it hard for players to came back into the game after a long pause. Most mechanics have changed and must be adaptes first leading to frustration. Players slowly understanding the mechanics will put into a constant re-learning when the patches changes the mechanics. Bestia will strictly strive for preserving once established gameplay mechanics and makes them as resistant as possible against patches.\n Interesting long term challenges have to be implemented via a immersive gameplay world. Bugs and balancing problems will be patched of course.\n Encouraging Social Interaction Many game mechanics should only be possible through interaction with other players. Rituals that require multiple players, even the help of multiple character classes should be the norm rather than the exception. Single players should of course also be able to enjoy the game. Nevertheless the name is MMORPG Program. The full potential of the game can and should only be experienced through interaction with other people. This promotes a cohesion in the community of the players. By these promoted social contacts the players are bound more strongly to the game itself.\nAdvanced Crafting Items are usually not obtained by killing monsters (we remember: fantasy realism.) Do wolves carry swords? Probably not. They have to be made. Usually only raw materials are found on maps. Almost all equipment is manufactured or purchased from NPCs. NPC dealers only have a limited stock of goods. These must first be restored and delivered. This leads to the establishment of trade routes. The price is determined by supply and demand. NPC should try to get a profit maximization for themselves. Players must be able to participate in this cycle of goods as easily as possible, both as a producer and as a consumer.\nThe professions are described in the Skills and Attacks section.\nModern Artifical Intelligence The game contains a modern, incredibly powerful AI. The world and its inhabitants should look incredibly alive with it. Bestias and NPC follow a daily routine and pursue their own goals. The player should be able to recognize patterns and interact with them by observing them. The NPCs react in the same way to influences by the player. NPCs should be able to travel long distances and not be available for the player for some time.\nRich And Immersive History The story and history should be rich in detail and deep and immersive. But its not necessairly important to be always totally serious. Yet it must be generic enough to get pre-computed to some degree when the world is calcualted. Instead the story should keep its own sense of strange, nerdy humor. Character development and ingame experiences should be tied to certain storys or quests. E.g. taking gameplay choices only by clicking a certain UI button is discouraged.\nReal World Expectation The environment should stick to real world expectation, can you open a door also by destroying it? Sure! Why should this not also work in games? - The simulated world of Bestia should stick to the principles and expectations of the real world. With this help player can think of funny and motivating workarounds and solutions to solve problems in game.\n"},{"idx":1,"href":"/docs/mechanics/skills/","title":"Attacks","content":" Attacks The magic and the usage of it plays a crucial role in the Bestia universe. The users should be able to be deeply involved into magic spell creation and research.\n The words Attacks and Spells are equally used.\n The system must allow the user to describe or discover newly innovative ways to combine spells. Yet the research should be fun and entertaining. Bestias can learn attacks by two means:\n Level Up - Each Bestia has a internal list of attacks she will learn when gaining levels. Spell Discovery - The player can try to \u0026ldquo;invent/discover\u0026rdquo; new attacks which then can be tried to be learned to a Bestia. This means 16 attacks until level 70 and about 4 attacks later on.  Magic Schools All attacks are divided into the three schools of magic: Arcane, Black or White Magic. These schools might be important if certain spells are increased via a learned skill.\nArcane Magic This describes \u0026lsquo;trickster\u0026rsquo; magic. It can be illusion spells, utility spells like generating food or shelter. There might be some rare kind of damaging spells but usually they contain transmutations and other fancy spell effects.\nBlack Magic Mostly damaging spells which are meant to inflict harm. These might be damaging spells or spells which directly inflict damage or harming status of its receiver like lowering defense or status values.\nWhite Magic The Healing, Buff or protection spells. These also contain detection of spells and neutralization spells of magic. generally all kind of protection, healing or improving stati fall into the domain of white magic.\nLearning Attacks Attacks are either learned via leveling up, vie the Spell Discovery skill or via Spell Scrolls which can be traded (but are rather expensive).\nFor leveling up a Bestia a general rule of thumb is:\n A Bestia should have about 20 Attacks. 80% of the attacks should be learned from level 1 - 69. The last 20% of the attacks between level 70 - 100.  Spell Discovery Spells can be discovered by the player. If he has the skill Spell Discovery. The maximum attack learnable by the skill level is given in the table below.\n   Spell Discovery Lv. max. Attack Level Discoverable     1 10   2 20   3 30   4 40   5 50   6 60   7 70   8 80   9 90   10 100    To discover a spell an aspect is chosen like \u0026lsquo;White Magic\u0026rsquo;, \u0026lsquo;Black Magic\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;Arkane Magic\u0026rsquo;.\nTBD\nSpell Enscription If the player owns the skill Spell Enscription he can attach the spell to scrolls or even to other entities.\nAfter a spell has been materialized and bound to some kind of magic containment it can be used by the owner. Spells of a higher level are of course far harder to handle. Attaching or handling such spells could produce unwanted side effects depending on the spell (some spells might create explosions, others might teleport something away or randomly heal bystanders etc.)\nSpell Binding Most if not each entity/object in the game world have slots and triggers to which spells can be attached to. If the player has the skill Spell Binding he can discover such slots and triggers on entities as well as trying to bind spells to such entities.\nTrigger Types  Entity entering or leaving range Special Entity entering or leaving range (Name, Type etc.) Presence of Magic rising of falling Weather Conditions Time Spell Cast in Range  Detection of Magic If the user has learned Detect Magic. The detection itself is easier if the spell is more powerful. However precautions can be used to avoid the spell getting detected. If more than one spell is attached to an object the less powerful spells are harder to detect.\n"},{"idx":2,"href":"/docs/mechanics/resources/","title":"Resources","content":" Resources Resources are raw materials used to sell to other players. They can be used to craft items or construct buildings. Resources can be obtained by the following means:\n Killing enemies and loot them Gathering of natural resources in the game world Using special extracting buildings or devices Recycling of existing items   The item loot from monster should be logically correct: a dead wolve would very likly not drop iron ore or golden coins.\n Dropped items in the world are semi-permanent. The player have a strong incentive to gather dropped items to participate in the market.\n Dropped items usually persist for up to 4 days (96 h real time) before they are deleted by the server.\n Mana Mana pervades the world. The concentration of mana flows is redefined in each incarnation of Bestias plays. Mana concentration is used, among other things, to determine how quickly the Bestia regenerate mana in a particular area. Mana is a two-edged-sword: As resource its quite valuable but concentrating it in a small area can lead to magic build up and lead to magic-storms or even rift events which will attract strong Bestias. In areas with high concentration magical artifacts can be built, powerful rituals can be held and mana can be \u0026ldquo;harvested\u0026rdquo; to transport it for research purposes.\nResource Types The following base types of resources exist in the game.\n   Typ Occurrence Usage     Ores, Minerals, Crystals Mountains, Caves Raffinery, Alchemy, Magic, Blacksmiths   Mana World Magical Uses   Herbs World, especially Forrests Magic Uses \u0026amp; Alchemy   Wood Forrests Material   Stone Mountains Material   Salts Mountains, Sea Material    Resource List    Name Type Description     Iron Metal    Steel Metal    Silver Metal    Gold Metal    Platin Metal    Copper Metal    Mercury Metal    Blue Mana Christal Salt    Yellow Mana Christal Salt    Red Mana Christal Salt    NaCl Salt     Item Recycling For each item is a list of base resources which the item is roughly based upon (this list is also used when forging or creating the item). When an attempt to recycle the item there is a chance that the item is destroyed and the resources are lost.\nThe base chance for item recylcing is:\n   Item Lv. Base Resource Reclaim     1 - 20 65%   21 - 60 45%   \u0026gt; 61 25%     The chance can be altered by players INT (slightly) and DEX and also by the apropriate skill.\n If successfull performed a recycling attempt the amount of captured resources is determined:\n   Item Lv. Base Resource Reclaim     1 - 20 60%   21 - 60 40%   \u0026gt; 61 20%     This is the base chance which is altered by the Scavenger skill as well as INT (slightly) and DEX.\n "},{"idx":3,"href":"/docs/api/","title":"Api","content":" REST API The Bestia game will get an extensive and public API to allow external developer to interface with the gameworld and create their own solutions and Apps.

Its job is the visualization of the game world. It synchronizes with the game server and will display entities so the player is able to interact with them.\nThe server is build similar to a Entity Component System. The client utilizes this architecture as well. It receives updates for the entities and reads the assigned components in order to display items, structures and entities.\nIt also transmits the voxel model of the world and visualizes the game map by the Godot Voxel plugin.\n "},{"idx":5,"href":"/docs/client/entities/","title":"Entities","content":" Entities The Bestia server entities are synched to the client also represented there also under the name Entities. An entity is described by a set of components which is attached to it and by a certain kind of logic synched between the client and the server. Not every component is synched though. This can depend on various factors for example party membership (ConditionComponent is only synched between members of the same party), or ownership or view distance (mostly only entities in view distance are synched).\nInteraction Behavior When the player wants to interact with an entity we must provide a way to fast and easy detect the default interaction between the player and the entity. There are several problems here:\n Interaction options can vary on dynamics like equipment and need to be checked by a server side script Interactions must be saved for a group of entites so the player does not check every enemy he wants to attack There should be sensible defaults. Items should be picked by default, enemies attacked  List of Interactions  Attack1 Talk Read Use Trade Pickup Construct Gather Resources  1: Attack is always possible for entites as each entity should be attackable in the game.\nGrouping of Entities The grouping is hard to determine as the engine has no real clue which type an entity belongs to. For the player the most distinctive visual clue would be the entity model which is used for display.\nThe BehaviorService is responsible for checking the possible interactions and presenting the player the usable options, the algorithm is as follows:\n  var config = { theme: 'dark' }; mermaid.initialize(config);  graph TD s1[Request Interaction list from server]--s2[Is saved default interaction present?] s2-- Yes --s3[Is default interaction present in list?] s3-- Yes --s4[Did user request manual selection?] s4-- Yes --s6((Open Interaction Menu)) s4-- No --s5((Perform interaction)) s2-- No --s7[Fetch default interaction for entity] s7-- Found --s5 s7-- Not Found--s6 "},{"idx":6,"href":"/docs/mechanics/dev-resources/","title":"Dev Resources","content":" Artwork and Design The general art style will be comic like as for example World of Warcraft.

The magic pushed into his world and merged it with another one. This altered the physical properties of both worlds and mostly destroyed them. He is thrown into a new one and must learn to survive on his own (while exploring the new world, making friends and foes.)\nThe principle of destroying the world is the common thread throughout the game. By joining one of the different cults the players can actively work towards a destruction of the world as well as prenting it from harm (see The Cults).\nDue to this event the world is generated dynamically. Despite the ultimate goal of the game to prevent or initiate this destruction, this should remain a rare event that occurs no more frequently than every 1 to 2 years (real time). The newly generated world should cover as wide a spectrum of biomes as possible. The world and its inhabitants embed themselves in a certain history, which should also be generated as automatically as possible. This enriches the player experience especially in the beginning when there are not many players.\nFor the details of world generation, see the technical documentation.\nThe Persistent Threat After a random period of time (at least 6 months in real time), threats starts to appear in every world. These can be threats from particularly strong Bestia, which cause great destruction, but also magical elements or natural disasters such as meteorites. Under certain conditions, this event can also contribute to the destruction of the world. If the total destruction is caused by the event then none of the cults will benefit from it. So it is in the interest of the cult players to avert this threat together.\nPopulation \u0026lt; 1k  delay = 9 + rand() * 1.5;  Population \u0026lt; 5k  delay = 9 + rand() * 2.5;  Population \u0026gt; 5k  delay = 9 + rand() * 4;   A threat does not necessarily have to be perceived directly. A meteor, or severe flooding, can take place far away, changing parts of the world without much of the player community noticing but permanently shaping and changing the world. A subtle fear of this change should always haunt players.\nPossible events are:\n Meteorite Impact Extreme Weathers (Storms or extreme cold over multiple days) Vulcanic eruptions Tsunami / Permanent Flooding Wildfire / Mana Fires Opening of a Rift and pouring in strong Bestias World bosses showing up Mana cristallization making the land uninhabitable  Quests The game will be more or less an Open World game. But the declared goal will be to try out new ways of storytelling in order to present a credible world with developing history to the players. You have to say goodbye to the idea that every game can live through every part of the story/quest. This contradicts the persistent and inner logical structure of the game world. Quests must rather result dynamically from what happens within the game world.\nHelp the Peasants!  A rich harvest is imminent, but the farmer Wilhelm cannot bring in the whole harvest due to his short time before it spoils on the fields. He asks passing players if they could help him. This is rewarded with an EXP bonus, gold and if necessary an item.  Defend the city!  Due to high rift activity and mana flooding, many high-level Bestias make the surroundings of a large city unsafe. Players are encouraged to fight the Bestias, rise in the city\u0026rsquo;s favor, and gain access to better items, experience and gold.  Help me!  A NPC has gotten lost in a dangerous area and is now hiding. If a player finds the NPC he can help him to find his way back and will be rewarded with EXP and gold.   Quests Generation Quests in Bestia are generated on via two mechanics:\n Automatic generated quests Player generated quests, these challanges must be given to an NPC who will then announce these quests so other players can pick them up.  Automatic Quests This documentation might help to build an automatic quest narrative system.\n http://rapturerebornmmorpg.wikia.com/wiki/Quest_Generation_system https://www.gamedev.net/topic/648285-latest-trends-in-procedural-quest-generation/ http://escholarship.org/uc/item/004129jn?query=The%20Grail%20Framework: http://larc.unt.edu/ian/pubs/pcg2011.pdf http://www.aaai.org/Papers/AIIDE/2006/AIIDE06-036.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/e38f/523ba64f014def436ebb03166eb4e573cc3a.pdf https://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~script/publications/2013aiide.pdf http://www.academia.edu/4558587/Dynamic_Quest_Plot_Generation_using_Petri_Net_Planning https://larc.unt.edu/techreports/LARC-2010-02.pdf http://gram.cs.mcgill.ca/papers/kybartas-14-analysis.pdf https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/de12/486ae621c3f074691069da4e4a5097c7a48f.pdf  Player Quests Players can define various tasks, such as collecting resources or defeating certain enemies, or transporting certain goods as a task and offer a reward. Also the deactivation of Bestias as guardians would be a conceivable task. This reward must then be given to the appropriate NPCs, who then hold it in trust (or simply negotiate among the players).\nThe awarding of quests must be worthwhile for both parties. The player is credited with a good amount of experience both for the quest and for the successful completion of the quest by another player. He can redistribute this experience to Bestias in his possession under certain circumstances (items needed). When a quest is accepted, a contract is concluded between the player and the NPC. If all contract conditions are met, the reward will be handed out. Contracts may be limited in time.\nPostal System Based on World of Warcraft, a postal system is to be established. The system should make it possible to send letters, but above all items and money to other players and places. But unlike most games, it should not be an \u0026ldquo;out-of-world\u0026rdquo; system. It would be conceivable that players would have to organize the system themselves and send Bestia as postmen to remote locations in Aventerra. This should take the speed out of the game. Arrival will have to be waited longer and the effort for the players will increase.\nIt would also be conceivable to have a paid telegram system for players to transport messages with valuable goods faster and safer (but then costs considerably more gold). It would be very nice to have one or more NPCs to transport the mail in the game. This could then become a victim of robberies and highwaymen like players themselves. It is just not sure if the AI is able to perform such tasks reliably.\nWorld Exploration A large part of the game world is generated automatically. There should be a motivation for players in exploring the world. New areas can be mapped and unique resources can be discovered and explored. In general, players should have their own branch about the secrets of the world to discover new items and how they are created. The entire world must gradually be explored and mapped by players. A hidden map has to be uncovered regularly. Players will be able to view this map online and see the overall progress of the exploration.\nPossible events can then also be announced on this public map. Every player should be able to create a world map in-game. Special cartographers should be able to combine these maps or generate new magic maps to inform about possible events (exchange information with friends via markers, or display certain resource sources).\nTo make even more impact the explored maps are very needed by the general player population in order to preciesly target locations or send Bestias into the area for certain AI controlled missions. The maps, once created, can thus be copied and sold by the cartographer. Regular player might try to create copies but this will be very hard without a cartography skill and most likly fail.\nExploring of the land should be a fun process but not so easy as going into the wild and pressing one simple button.\nFor generating the visual of the player map we use the algorithm described in Terrain Map Generation and its respective Github repository\nCartography In the game you should be able to make and acquire maps. These should be strongly interwoven with the game mechanics, so that it can pay off to own a good map. It should also give the players an incentive to actively explore the world.\nThe player has to walk into the wilderness and then use his cartography skill. He can choose how wide the area to measure should be. Bigger areas will tend to be more error prone. Also the further away the player is from already explored land the harder the sucessfull performing of the skill will be.\nIf the skill fails the player will need to wait for a certain amount of time in order to perform the skill again in the vicinity. The cooldown is reduced for adjacent areas.\nThe server must validate the button presses of the player for success.\nSkill Usage  Upon using the skill a difficulty d is determined, depending on the distance to the next already cartographed area and the area wished to be explored. There are 3-5 locations l spawned around the player within a radius of 300 to 800 meters around the player (depending on the difficulty). He must reach them within a timelimit t. When near one of such a location (5m) the player is given a moving compass graphic. The speed of moving needle and the area to hit via button press is calculated based on d.  The Cults In each Bestia World there are 2-3 cults to which the Bestia summoners can belong. When creating the world, the existing cults are chosen randomly. At least one cult should long for the destruction of the world, one should prevent it. Optionally there are some neutral cults that pursue their own goals which do not deal with the destruction of the world. These cults should not exist in every world iteration.\nThe cults are ultimately a faction. The goal is to be able to play these factions among themselves. Usually players can fight against each other at any time, but the rivalries should take place between the cults. To this end, game mechanics must be established that in a certain way grant the individual cults an additional bonus in a collaborative approach and thus offer playful incentives to actively intervene in the game.\nPlayers should be able to change cults. However, this will be sanctioned with a difficult task and will be associated with various disadvantages.\nCult Advantages It would be conceivable that special land areas fall under the influence of a certain cult. This would attract certain Bestias that are friendly to the cult members. Special resources are generated or more Mana rifts are opened and the Mana within the country increases there. Furthermore, the prevailing faction can be rewarded with a global bonus. Additional EXP bonuses would be conceivable.\nArchivements If a player manages to archive a certain goal then he will be awarded an archivement. These archivements are listed ingame so the player can view them. It is also possible for other players to access the players archivements.\nThere are archivements which are unique to a single world and other which every player can reach for his own. World archivements are saved with the world they were acquired and are reset (they can be re-acuired by another player if the world is re-created). The date + the name of the world in which the success was achieved always remains in the history for a player.\nThis list is far from completed! New ideas and suggestions are welcomed. Please open an issue or directly make a pull request for new ideas.\nList of Archivements Master of 10 Bestias World Individual  The player has owned 10 Bestias.\nMaster of 100 Bestias World Individual  The player has owned 100 Bestias.\nMaster of 1000 Bestias World Individual  The player has owned 1000 Bestias.\nMaster of 10k Bestias World Individual  The player has owned 10k Bestias.\nOfficer World Individual  Killing 10 players with Rogue debuf.\nGrand Officer World Individual  Killing 20 players with Rogue debuf.\nSheriff World Individual  Killing 60 players with Rogue debuf.\nGreat Sheriff World Individual  Killing 100 players with Rogue debuf.\nMarshall World Individual  Killing 200 players with Rogue debuf.\nGreat Marshall World Individual  Killing 500 players with Rogue debuf.\nTrading Trading is an important mechanic and allows player to exchange goods. Players can create auction hauses which can be used in order to perform trades while they are offline themselves.\nAuction House TBD\n"},{"idx":8,"href":"/docs/mechanics/statusvalues/","title":"Statusvalues","content":" Status Values Status Values are the base values from which the basics for all ingame calculations are performed. There are four main types of values: Base Values, Status Valus, Condition Values and Effort Values. The Status Based Values (SBV) play a special role.\nThe sophisticated status system describes the current state of an bestia (or simply any living entity) and does not strictly apply only to biological entities. The status system is important to calculate all battle related effects in the game.\nThe status system knows the following different attributes. These attributes are directly used to calculate the gameplay effects like battle outcomes or skill usages.\nStatus values are calculated like so:\nstr = (baseStr * 2 + ivStr + effStr / 4) * level / 100 + 5 The caluclation differs for mana and HP calculation thought:\nmaxHp = baseHp * 2 + ivHp + effHp / 4 * level / 100 + 10 + level maxMana = baseMana * 2 + ivMana + effMana / 4 * level / 100 + 10 + level * 2 Intelligence (INT)  Main influence value for magic domain related effects and power/damage of magic based attacks and skills. Increases the duration of magical effects from the player (buffs, skills, etc) Increases the total amount of available mana  Willpower (WIL)  Increases resistance against enemy spells and magic effects. Increases mana regeneration over time Increases the duration of magic effects from the player Reduces cast duration of spells Increases slightly the stamina regeneration Increases slightly the total amount of stamina Slightly increases resistance against temperature  Strength (STR)  Increases damage of physical attacks (and slightly the damage of distance attacks) Increases carry capacity Increases the maximum HP amount slightly Increases the maximum stamina amount slightly  Vitality (VIT)  Reduces the damage of physical attacks Increases the HP regeneration over time Increases the maximum amount of HP Increases the stamina regeneration Increases the maximim amount of stamina Increases resistence against temperature  Dexterity (DEX)  Increases the hitchance of physical based attacks Increases the probability of a critical hit Increases the damage of a distance attack  Agility (AGI)  Increases the attack rate Increases the walking speed Increases the dodge chance (flee rate) for physical attacks (melee and distance)  Condition Values The Condition Values resemble the current condition of a entity.\nStamina (STA)  If stamina drops to low the walkspeed of the Bestia decreases  From 30% stamina to 0% stamina the walkspeed linearly decreases by 50%.  It gives resistance against environmental factors A stamina below 10% stops the mana and HP generation A stamina below 5% leads to a slow HP drop over time  0.3% of max HP loss every tick (leads to death in about 8h real time)  Stamina can be regenerated by resting in a safe spot or by using items  HP  HP is the life energy of a Bestia or entity. If the HP reaches 0 the Bestia is killed  Mana  Mana is the energy needed to cast spells or abilities. The more mana the Bestia has the more or bigger spells she can cast  Effort Values Upon level up of a Bestia it gains Gain Points which the player is free to distribute into his Effort Values to any of the status values.\nThese values are gained upon leveling up the Bestia and can freely assigned by the player as soon as he has some points to spend. However once spend these points are fixed and can not re-distributed anymore (there might be quests or NPC which are able to reset these values in a certain amount).\nThe gain of effort values for a entity is:\neffGain = 5 + floor(reachedLevel / 2) Upon leveling up the Effort Values the player needs to invest the number of Gain Points:\neffGainNeeded = max(1, (nextEffValue / 10) Status Based Values The status based values (SBVs) are important numbers used throughout the system to determine for example the walk speed or attack speed of an entity.\nIndividual Values The individual value IVs are generated when the Bestia spawns and makes this somewhat random. Its possible to find better or worst Bestia. By breeding Bestia this IVs are subject to manipulation by the player and it is possible to make stronger Bestia in a controlled way.\nBase Values Every Bestia has Base Values upon which the status values are calculated. With setting these values some baseline for status values can be controlled from the designer. Every status has its designated base value.\nFor other non Bestia based entities like items or buildings etc. base values are usually generated via a ruleset.\nEffective Status Values The effective status values a calculated by the base values and effort values of each bestia. These values are set when the entity is instanced. For other non Bestia entities like non living objects or NPCs the status values might just get assigned by a simpler mechanism.\nUsually the equipment or buffs (status effects) will alter the status points directly or indirectly. Both alterations are called status effects and might be semi-permanent (as long as the equip is worn) or temporarily (when the buff runs out).\nThe effective status values are taken into account when game calculations are performed.\nExperience The primary way to gain experience in the game is by fighting enemy Bestias. But there is also experience for more pacifistic players to gain through the use of skills. However, in order to give players no advantage over activly fighting players, the experience gained via skill use only rises linearly (opposing to the exponential exp needed growth of a Bestia).\nKilling Enemies Skill Usage Only activly used jobs will create experience.\nDeath Penalty Players Master can not die, they are reborn with a temporary malus. Which reduces all their stats by 15% for 15 minutes.\nA killed Bestia or Master loses 1% of their current experience points. The items are automatically protected via a spell which tries to teleport the items back to a secure storage after short duration (but remember: spells can be dispelled!).\nIf the player activates the so-called Hard Mode he gets an experience bonus as well as a loot bonus of +3%. However, if he dies he looses 5% of his current experience and items are not protected by default with a spell. If once activated the Hard Mode will take one hour real time cooldown in order to get switched again.. This should prevent players from switching the mode on and off quickly after detecting a dicey situation.\nIn both cases the items suffer a durability penality.\nBestias however, can be permanently get killed, if the killing blow is particularly strong.\n"},{"idx":9,"href":"/docs/server/datatypes/","title":"Datatypes","content":" Datatypes All locations and entities are represented via fixed point numbers to avoid incorrectness with floating points over a bigger distance (see The perils of floating point).\nPositioning The basic datastructures for positioning and collisions are found in net.bestia.model.geometry.

Bestias and NPCs alike should be able to create long-term plans, so-called game plans or GPs for short. They then follow this strategy until observations or influences from the game world force them to abandon this plan or the plan is fulfilled.\nBestias look for ways to get the highest possible inner happiness. They must sleep, eat and feel attracted to mana currents. Of course they try to avoid threats and protect their health. Here some subtypes differ from each other. Some tend to be aggressive and actively attack players and other Bestias, while others are shy and flee quickly. But there can also be representatives who are, as you would say, \u0026ldquo;stupid\u0026rdquo; and will attack players to death as soon as they come into sight.\nDecisions should be made on the basis of knowledge.

Dazu kommt ein umfassendes Set an internen Informationen wie Gesundheitszustand, Manavorrat, mögliche Attacken, Wissen über Geländebesonderheiten.\nDa die Bewertung der KI Strategie von der Entity selbst vorgenommen wird, sollen die Regeln zur evaluation der Strategie dynamisch zur Laufzeit anpassbar sein.

The framework must interact with the game engine in certain ways. It must have some notion of locality. The engine must be queried about environmental factors and the AI framework must be provided with a point object which it is able to save. Depending on this locations the game framework must be able to move agents to this points. Also the path planning and avoidance is highly dependent of the game and can not be part of the AI framework itself but must be provided by the game engine. It is very likely that there are different kind of AIs needed for one single game. There are low intelligence agents like small (or dumb) enemies and very intelligent agents like NPCs or bosses. Agents are described by an inner state which describes its next actions. The inner state might not always be a single, simple state (like a state machine) but can also inhibit a fuzzy behaviour. The inner state should be savable. The state transition should occur depending on the used state machine. Either there could be decision trees, variable controlled (fuzzy states) and many more. Either way there are transition function in place which take inputs from the environment and change directly the state or indirectly attributes which are used to ultimately calculate the current internal state. The AI transition function must have a way to actively query into the world state of the engine to gather informations. This could be sounds, smell or visual information of their environment and so on. This information is used to either directly change its internal state via its transition functions or this information is filtered and saved into the agent\u0026rsquo;s memory if a memory storage is provided. Environment information might also get delivered via events to the agent. Such information is usually not actively searched for. But a sudden explosion sound or enemy visual could lead to a change in behaviour and thus internal state. The agent must be able to re-evaluate its state upon the arrival of such events. Smart management and storage of environment information is also a complete new innovation: the introduction of memory supported AI. This could mean a AI is capable of remembering the positions of players habitats, hunting grounds etc.. Depending upon the AI the entity should be able to communicate this information to other entities (if it is capable of communicating). Since we won\u0026rsquo;t be able to correctly simulate the transfer of information via a language (might be the case for a later implementation) what we need is a way to configure the process of information exchange with other agents. It must be configurable which type of agents are able to exchange information, how close they must be to each other, do they need a special internal state until information is transferred and if the transfer starts how many information is shared how fast? Agents should decide for themselves (usually depending on the internal state how often they want to reevaluate the world around them since this is a costly operation). They can send a suggestion to the outermost control system how often they want to tick (a sleeping agent usually needs less processing than a fighting entity). However the external system has to decide how many spare resources it has and if necessary give the AI less ticks then they might suggest). Since the Bestia system is event based and not ticked based in order to avoid unnecessary evaluations we might need a filter which will ignore certain incoming events to avoid costly operations. Inner states might lead to desires. There must be a function for certain group of entities which maps the internal state to a current, certain goal. The strongest goal determines which actions are currently performed. The mapping of this Goal(State) function is highly agent and game dependent and thus must be provided by the user of the framework. There might be some default desires like eating, sleeping, idle etc.. Long term goal and behaviour planning If the internal states suggest the agent is hungry which leads to a desire to eat we must have a way to plan how this desire can be fulfilled in a changing and complex external world. Therefore we need a mapping of goals to a list of actions. A action is a small subunit and should be able to be directly performed by the entity inside the game world. In order to perform correct goal into action mappings the agent needs some additional informations about actions like for example the estimated execution time or other cost factors so a cheapest path can be found of the current state to the goal. The actions are then saved into a queue and performed one after another by asking the game engine to perform this action in behalf of the agent. The agent must be able to ask the game if the action has been performed or if it\u0026rsquo;s maybe unable to execute the action at all. If this is the case a revaluation of the goal to action list must be performed. Some actions might be available all the time (drop an item) but some actions might only be possible in certain circumstances (mana is not empty, a certain tool lies on the ground). It is the job of the goal solver to assess all possible actions for a certain agent until the search for the best action solution towards the goal can be found. Architecture Agents Agents contain a “Memory”. Inside this memory certain events are recorded and the agent can access this information for evaluation the next actions. The memory\u0026rsquo;s size must be adjustable to limit memory consumption. Depending on the memory and the agent the memory is eventually dropped from the internal state or its weight reduces in decision making (a seen item might drop in relevance over time). Agents act to fulfill “Desires” Agents perform actions in order to fulfill the current active desire. Agents can form groups and exchange “memory”. Agents contain a state which describes internal “values” like e.g. hunger, thirst, health etc. based on this internal state and external circumstances desires are planned. Receive environmental events like sound, smell or vision. Each change of world state (e.g. received event) can lead to a reevaluation of its internal state/goals/desires.\nAgentState Attributes can be added by the user. Some state values are getting “better” the higher they are, some should be lowered. (e.g. hunger is bad if its value is high. But sleepiness is good when it goes low). Some/all values have a decay function. Their values change over time. Desires Are fulfilled by a planned list of actions. Desire have a priority. The desire to stay alive might be higher than to move from a to b. Some desires are permanent some are temporary. The possible actions are layed out to optimize against a agent dependent weight function. Some actors maybe want to save money, some might save time etc.\nQuestions How are desires evaluated as “fullfilled”?\nExternal System Calls AI manager in more or less regular intervals to evaluate state changes. External system provides interface for environmental access. Perform Actions Query informations about the state of certain actions Estimate the cost of an action\nAIGoalSolver AIs must be able to solve complex operations in order to fulfill a desire. Example: Desire: Sleep Goal for animal: Find sleeping place → sleep Sleep Goal for human: Go home → go to bed → sleep\nDesire evaluation For example the most important desire for most agents would be to stay alive. In order to do so they have a high importance to maximize the internal health state. The goal evaluator will pick one out of all possible actions, the action will alter the state and then the improvement will be evaluated. For example:\nAgent It has in its internal memory two locations A and B of possible food saved. Near location A is also saved that there is an enemy 1 hour ago. B is further away.\nThe agent gets very hungry and the desire to reduce the hunger is picked and placed as the current and thus most important one. The goal solver now tries to solve this desire. The solver looks in all possible actions for the entity: Pick up food (there is no food around, thus this action is not legal) Move (has a bit of a cost associated) The solver picks move because the memory says there are two places with food. CONSIDER THE ENEMY The solver calculates how long it would take to perform the move action (time will increase our hunger) and pick the shortest way. The main factors to drive AI decisions How long does an action take to perform? How much impact has the action? (measured by how much our internal state changes to the better or to the worst). AI evolution The most complex feature should be AI evolution. The AI should be able to evaluate its actions against a fitness function in order to start alternating or changing the transition functions. This could be either changing the whole decision tree or only changing some parameters in order to optimize behaviour. This evolution should be configurable. Some AI behaviour should simply not be able to change. Maybe some sort of evolutionary algorithm could be used to evaluate the AI actions. This would need two components: a fitness function evaluating the performance of the AI for certain criterions and a encoding scheme to encode the transition functions into a genetic code used for mutating after applying pressure.\nAIPoint is used as notion of locality in the world. Points must be serializable so they can be saved with various locations. Path planning and waypoint generation There is a global waypoint and path network Long term planning only available for agents which have learned about the way Learning happens by: reading, questing, exploring the way of its own, drawing maps\n"},{"idx":11,"href":"/docs/server/battlesystem/","title":"Battlesystem","content":" Battle system The battle or attack is performed in various stages.

In certain areas it is refined in order to better express the design philosophy of Bestia as well as be extensible. Modifier (MOD suffix) are float values representing percentage values (e.g. 0.25). Bonus mods are bigger than 1 (bonus 5% is 1.05) while reduction modifier are less than 1.\nThe damage at the end is rounded down but the damage is capped at 0. The calculation of the BASE_ATK is rather complex and is explained inside a own section. The parts written in pink are variables provided by bonuses from equips, stats, buffs etc.\nDamage = floor(BASE_ATK * ATK_MOD * HARD_DEF_MOD * CRIT_MOD - SOFT_DEF)\nBASE_ATK The base attack represents the attack strength of an entity. This attack strength is based on the status values important to perform the attack as well as the properties of the currently equipped weapon. Equipment might also alter the status values by which the base attack is indirectly influenced.\nThe base attack is capped at a minimum of 1. Default formula for physical and magical melee and magic ranged attack:\nBASE_ATK = (2 * STATUS_ATK * VAR_MOD + WEAPON_ATK * VAR_MOD_RED + SKILL_ATK + BONUS_ATK) * ELEMENT_MOD * ELEMENT_BONUS_MOD\nFor physical ranged attacks the formula is calculated as follows (ammo_atk is used):\nBASE_ATK = (2 * STATUS_ATK * VAR_MOD + WEAPON_ATK * VAR_MOD_RED + AMMO_ATK + SKILL_ATK + BONUS_ATK) * ELEMENT_MOD * ELEMENT_BONUS_MOD\nSTATUS_ATK The status attack value is determined by the capabilities of the character to attack and inflict damage. The formula is different for magic and physical based attacks.\nFor physical melee attacks:\nSTATUS_ATK = LV / 4 + STR + DEX / 5\nFor physical ranged attacks:\nSTATUS_ATK = LV/4 + DEX + STR / 5\nFor magical attacks (melee and ranged):\nSTATUS_ATK = LV/4 + INT + WILL / 5\nVAR_MOD Is a variable status modifier. The variance is reduced as the DEX value rises. It is defined as:\nVAR_MOD = 1 - (RAND(1,0) * 0.15)\nWEAPON_ATK The weapon attack value for physical attacks is given by:\nWEAPON_ATK = (BASE_ATK * QUALY_MOD + REFINE_BONUS) * SIZE_MOD * RACE_MOD * WEAPON_BONUS_MOD\nWhere as the WEAPON_ATK value for magical attacks is given by:\nWEAPON_ATK = (BASE_ATK * QUALY_MOD + REFINE_BONUS) * RACE_MOD\nQUALY_MOD The QUALY_MOD is a modification depending of the quality of the weapon. Each weapon has a quality rating which is basically not capped. But the max quali damage mod should converge to +30% at maximum.\nFrom this rating the mod damage is calculated as follow\nQUALI_MOD = QUALY / 100\nSIZE_MOD The SIZE_MOD is determined between the size of the opponent and the type of the used weapon against him. The size mod is only applied when the attack is physically based.\n  Weapon size Enemy size Modifier   Small Small 1.3   Medium Small 1   Big Small 0.75   Small Medium 1   Medium Medium 1.15   Big Medium 1   Small Big 0.70   Medium Big 1.1   Big Big 1.3   VAR_MOD_RED This is the reduced variance mod.\nVAR_MOD_RED = VAR_MOD - VAR_MOD / 2 + 1\u0026frasl;2\nAMMO_ATK If special ammunition is used this value is used. Only ranged physical attacks can make use of ammunition.\nBONUS_AMMO This value is determined by the equipment and status effects applied to an entity.\nATK_MOD The ATK_MOD is calculated depending which type the attack was. If it was a ranged physical attack, ranged magic attack or a melee physical or a melee magic based attack. The attack mod is capped to 0.05.\nIf attack is physical melee:\nATK_MOD = bonus_physical_melee\nIf attack is physical ranged:\nATK_MOD = bonus_physical_ranged\nIf attack is magical melee:\nATK_MOD = bonus_magical_melee\nIf attack is physical melee:\nATK_MOD = bonus_physical_melee\nHARD_DEF Hard defense represents mostly the damage reduction via armor and other natural defenses. It can of course modified by scripts. The hard defense is capped between 0 and 95%. Depending of the nature of the attack (physical or magical) either the normal armor or magic armor (magic resist) is used.\nIf normal attack (ranged or melee):\nHARD_DEF = 100 - (TOTAL_ARMOR_MOD + PHYSICAL_DEF_MOD) / 100\nIf magic attack (ranged or melee):\nHARD_DEF= 100 - (TOTAL_MAGIC_RESIST_MOD + MAGIC_DEF_MOD) / 100\nSOFT_DEF Soft defense represents the natural defense of entities against damage of a specific domain. Soft def is a natural number and NO modifier. Its minimum value is capped to 0.\nIf attack is physical based (regardless if melee or ranged):\nSOFT_DEF = LV / 2 + VIT + STR / 3\nIf the attack is magic based (regardless if melee or ranged):\nSOFT_DEF= LV / 2 + VIT + WILL / 4 + INT / 5\nCRIT_MOD The base crit mod is set so 1.4 (bonus of 40% damage) if a critical hit has occurred. The chance to land a critical hit is determined before the actual damage is calculated. If no critical hit has occurred the crit mod is hardcoded set to 1. Magic based attacks can not land a critical hit (they also are hitting a target easier).\nThe crit mod is capped at 1.\nCRIT_MOD = BASE_CRIT_MOD * CRIT_DAMAGE_MOD\nDamage variables Total damage calculation modifiers which are gathered from equipment and status effects.

An example would be the teleport ability: after selecting the players (which can be flexible by the number) and the magic interference at the destination, the player must win a small mini-game in the client which can be a skill game. Depending on how successful this was, the player will be more precisely transported to the destination.\nUltimately, it remains important to leave the outcome of skills open in some way. However, the result should remain understandable and influenceable by the player.\nSkill Progression Upon each level up the master gains 1 skillpoint to put into the skills rank. This is permanent and means a player can spend about 100 points for improving the ranks of his skills.\n Since max level is not capped actually he might be able to spend more points but a progressions gets continously harder it is safe to assume every player has about 100 points.\n The skilltrees are designed as such that to reach the highest professions in a tree the player needs to spend 70 points.\nThe player can decide to have mediocre profession in each tree or to max out one and have maybe half of the meaningful professions of another tree. The skilltree is a hierarchical dependency of skills.\nCommon Tree In this tree, simple, common mundane tasks are placed.\nFirst Aid Cooking (5) Fishing (5) Battle Tree The battle tree contains skills which are primarly useful for fighting, battle and maybe to some extend improve survival in the wild.\n  var config = { theme: 'dark' }; mermaid.initialize(config);  graph TD SPRITIUAL_MASTERY(\"Spritual Mastery [5]\") ELEMENTAL_MASTERY(\"Elemental Mastery [5]\")--|min. 3|MASTER_OF_FIRE(\"Master of Fire [10]\") ELEMENTAL_MASTERY--|min. 3|MASTER_OF_WATER(\"Master of Water [10]\") ELEMENTAL_MASTERY--|min. 3|MASTER_OF_WIND(\"Master of Wind [10]\") ELEMENTAL_MASTERY--|min. 3|MASTER_OF_EARTH(\"Master of Earth [10]\") Elemental Mastery (5) Increases damage or healing of spells with elemental (earth, wind, wasser, fire) domain.\n +3% damage/level\n Master of Fire (10)  Elemental Mastery (3)  Increases the damage of fire attacks.\n +3% damage/level\n Master of Water (10)  Elemental Mastery (3)  Increases damage of water spells.\n +3% damage/level\n Master of Wind (10) Elemental Mastery (3)\nIncreases damage of wind spells.\n +3% damage/level\n Master of Earth (10) Elemental Mastery (3)\nIncreases damage of earth spells.\n +3% damage/level\n Spritual Mastery (5) Increases damage or healing of spells with the Holy or Dark domain.\n +5% damage/level\n Mindbreak (5) This is a buff which once it gets applied reduces the armor but increases the physical and magical attack of a Bestia.\n +20% damage/level\n-20% armor/level\n Mindfocus (5) This is a buff which once it gets applied increases the armor but decreases the physical and magical attack of a Bestia.\n +20% armor/level\n-20% damage/level\n Survival Tree The survival tree has three main ideas: protecting the masters Bestia from physical harm by increasing they tougness indirectly, improving the survivability in harsh environments for his Bestias or others.\nImproved Healing (10) Increases effects of healing done and duration of buff spells when used by the owner of this spell.\n +2% effect/level\n Increased Regeneration (10) Your Bestias and Masters HP and Mana will have an increased regeneration rate.\n +3% effect/level\n Magic Armor (5)  Improved Healing (5)  Reduces damage of magical effects.\n -2%/level reduced damage\n Faster Travel (5) Hard terrain does not reduce the Bestia movement speed anymore.

This is by design! Yet there should be incentives for players not to go this route in order to protect low level players from ganking of other griev play. If a player behaves well and their honor level increases they will get more and more rewards. On the other hand if a player has negative honor they will get bad reputation and repressions. There might actually be some player initiated hunt on these low honor players.\nAdditionally each NPC maintains an internal list of reputation points and players. If a player misbehaves or behaves in a friendly way, this list will be adjusted. The NPC also communicates this list with other NPCs if they meet. If the reputation exceeds certain upper and lower limits and the NPC enters areas that use a long-distance communication system, the NPC may also communicate this to more distant areas. Only if the players reputation falls below -100 the NPC encountered (and acted negative towards them) they remembers this permanently. Higher values slowly return to the default value of 0 and are then removed from the list (NPCs don\u0026rsquo;t forget if a player killed family members or the NPC life was saved). If the customer reaches the nearest settlement via the reputation points after a certain time, the value is also stored there permanently.\nReputation decreases faster through bad deeds than increasing because of good ones.\nProtected Zones Around the starting places there will be a enchantment in place which will mark the lands in the vacinity as Protected Zones. Inside this zone every kill of another player Bestia with more then 5 levels less as the killing bestia or NPC will reduce the honor by 20 points.\nEvery action which leads to honor loss inside a protected zone (other then killing a low level Player Bestia) will be multiplied by 3 wheras honor increasing actions will be multiplied by 1.5.\nNegative Honor As there are multiple factions which different interests it is not easy to define which play is considered bad behavior which will get punished automatically. Yet there are some core actions which will be universally be considered as griev play which is not inherently forbidden but will result in a loss of honor.\nIf a player drops below 0 honor he will receive the debuff Rogue. If a player has less then -100 honor he will receive the debuff Outlaw.\nStealing Stealing means if a player picks up an item from a storage chest not belonging to him. The owner can also grant certain player access right to a chest. Then its not considered stealing. A guild leader can also mark storage chests as usable for guild members.\nA player who steals an item is also marked with the debuff Thief which will grant any player who kills him 5 extra honor. The killing player also gets a honor reward for each item returned to the original owner of the items within 6 real time hours (18 hours in Bestia time).\nMalicious Actions    Malicious Action Honor Loss (Player) Honor Loss to NPC in Sight     Killing a NPC -5 -15   Killing Players Bestias 0 -2   Killing Players Bestias in a Protected Zone -20 -20   Stealing Item (Mundane) -5 -10   Stealing Item (Superior) -10 -20   Stealing Item (Legendary) -15 -50    Negative Honor Effects If the honor drops below 0 the negative effects will start to take place. The effects are as follows:\n   Honor Amount Effect     \u0026lt; 0 No more advantages from NPC and the NPC will act unfriendly against the player.   \u0026lt; -50 Some NPC might start to act hostile and attack the player or flee from him.   \u0026lt; -100 NPC will permanently remember the player and also spread the word around so more NPC will start to act hostile towards the player.    If a player steals something not belonging to him but to a NPC or another player he will loose honor for each item he takes and depending on the item level (looting a dead NPC/player will not lead to a reduction of honor).\nPositive Honor A positive honor level will lead to very friendly NPC which might even give the player some discounts or gifts from time to time. In order to increase your honor level again you can:\n Kill a player with negative honor Helping a NPC by healing or resurrecting a dead NPC  Shrines of Judgement There are a 5 shrines in each game world incarnation where a player can sacrifice to raise a reputation that has fallen below the threshold of a player\u0026rsquo;s global persecution. The sacrifice is usually (depending on the reputation threshold) very painful and even if it was made it can take several days until the news about it was spread.\n"},{"idx":15,"href":"/docs/","title":"Docs","content":""},{"idx":16,"href":"/docs/mechanics/environment/","title":"Environment","content":" Environment Bestia uses a sophisticated temperature and environment system to drive weather simulation and the effects on the players environment.\nThese simulations should be based on certain basic values which are determined location-dependent, but can be changed by interaction with the players. Also natural changes through the world (seasons) should lead to an adjustment of these values. Due to the changes of the environmental values tiles have to be adapted to the world itself. These have to be adjusted anyway if they should change due to other local effects like fire or mining. The client must be informed about adjusted tiles.\nTemperature Each Bestia has a certain sweet spot of tolerable temperature. There are several kind of base temperature ranges in which Bestia thrive:\n   Temperature Kind Base Temperature Range [°C]     Low Temperature -20 - 15   Medium Temperature 10 - 30   High Temperature 25 - 45    Vitality and Willpower increases resistenace against the temperatures. Specialized equipments or status effects can also affect temperature resistence.\nThe formular is as follows:\n  $$ \\begin{aligned} T_{increase} \u0026= \\sqrt{\\text{VIT}} / 2\\\\ T_{increase} \u0026= \\sqrt{\\text{WILL}} / 4\\\\ \\end{aligned} $$ For items and structures these calculation is a bit different. Usually these items have some threshold above or under which they will start to malfunction or perhaps even catch fire.\nWeather The weather system in Bestia plays a crucial role. It also affects the visibility and also the behavior of the NPC and mobs. Depending on the weather the NPCs and the player character will need a improved shelter or equipment to avoid a loss of stamina.\nThe weather influences also the temperature which will in turn decide if and how much stamina a entity regenerates or loses.\nThe weather will also play a role in which crops and plants grow. If the player decided to plant salad in the desert this won\u0026rsquo;t work quite well.\nRain A in strength controllable rain effect should overlay the entire viewport. The rain blowing direction should correlate with the wind direction (which will be more or less random). During rain the ground will show a wet effect and view distance is reduced. It also reduces the effectiveness of fires and might extingush them. Fire attacks will lose certain strengths in a very wet environment (like burning effects won\u0026rsquo;t last very long).\nFog Clouds of fog will move slowly over the map. And the sight of the AI entities is reduced. Its will also get harder for a player to see.\nNight During night time the player will need light sources in order to improve the visibility of enemies or terrain. There will be certain items (e.g. torches, candles etc.) as well as spells to make light.\nIngame Time The time in the Bestia game is faster then the real world time. When we refer to the faster in-game time we will call it bestia time, if we refer to the normal time we call it real time.\nChanging seasons should lead to an impression of the changeability of the world. You have to adapt to a periodically changing environment. Things that work in summer may not be possible in winter. But so that the players don\u0026rsquo;t have to wait for a real year, time in Bestia flies faster.\nThe bestia time starts at the creation of the bestia world. It is basically three times faster then the usual time. This means that the normal bestia day has 8 hours in real time.\nThis means that the bestia month has 10 days in real time and an bestia year is 4 month in real time.\n Bestia year: 4 months Bestia seasion: summer, winter, fall, spring: each 1 month Bestia day: 8 hours  Time Calculation The easiest way to calculate the time in the Bestia world is the following:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} btime \u0026= time_{real} / 3 \\\\ btime_{hours} \u0026= btime / 3600\\\\ btime_{days} \u0026= btime_{hours} / 24\\\\ btime_{months} \u0026= btime_{days} / 30\\\\ btime_{years} \u0026= btime_{years} / 12 \\end{aligned} $$ This allows the player to see multiple day-night cycles on the same day while allowing him to play for a considerable time so he can actually do something meaningful until the sun rises again.\n If it turns out that the night period is too annyoing for the players because of the limited amount of gameplay then the night might get shortened.\n This caluclation results in the following example timespans:\n   Bestia Time Real Time     3 h 1 h   12 d 4 d   1 yr 4 mon    "},{"idx":17,"href":"/docs/mechanics/items/","title":"Items","content":" Items Items can be optained by the player and carried around. The amount of items limited to each entity is determined via its Inventory. Each Bestia (and also a lot of other entities), have their own inventory with different sizes.\nItems are mostly crafted by the players. Its quite rare to obtain direct item drops from killed enemies. Instead its very common to loot resources when enemies are killed.\nEach item has a level assigned. This level is important to determine how hard or easy it is to forge this item, upgrade it and so on. It also effects how spells interact with the item entity.\nItem Category Items are grouped into three categories and inside this documentation often refered to via its category.\n   Item Level Category     1 - 20 Mundane   21 - 80 Superior   81 - 100 Legendary   101+ Epic    Weapon Refinement Weapons and armors can be refined which accounts to extra damage dealt if the weapon is used. Each upgrade step can result in a destruction of the equipment.\nA refined weapon has increased base damage per level:\n   Weapon Category Base Damage Bonus / Upgrade Level     Mundane 2   Superior 4   Legendary 6   Epic 10    Uprade Chances These are the base upgrade chances. The chances can be altered via skills or item usages. If a upgrade fails the weapon is destroyed. It is then complelty unusable and also the resources are lost.\n   Weapon Category Uprade Formula     Mundane    $$ min(1, e^{-(itemLv-5)/9.8)}) $$    Superior  $$ min(1, e^{-(itemLv-4)/8.69)}) $$    Legendary  $$ min(1, e^{-(itemLv-3)/7.69)}) $$    Epic  $$ min(1, e^{-(itemLv-2)/7.31)}) $$     The refine level is not capped but each higher refinement process can destroy the weapon/equipment with an increasing chance. The chance of success is depending on skill and refine items used.\nA refined armor has increased resistance for hard defense. Each upgrade point grants ⅓ points more defense.\nThe upgrade chances can be increased by leveling up the Skill Mastery Upgrade Mastery.\nItem Crafting Bestia uses an innovative new item crafting. The player is basically is allowed to craft all items. Some items however might be so hard to craft so it is not possible to craft it without appropriate skill. Some items may require special ingredients which can not be substituted. The higher the crafted item level and the harder it get to successful craft it. If the crafting of the item fails all the materials used to craft it are lost. In order to craft an item two things are important: the sum of raw materials used to craft and how the materials are laid out.\nItem craft success chance is determined if the raw materials.\nAfter an item was successfully crafted the recipe is saved for the user inside his recipe list. From this list the recipe can be inscribed upon a paper to give it to other players who can consume and learn it. The learning will take some time (depending of the level of the item).\nPlayers are encouraged to try and create stuff. There are basically 6 domains of craftable and user generatable content in the world of Bestia, and are related to the linked Skill Mastery.\n Weapons (Blacksmith: Weapon) Armor (Blacksmith: Armor) Magical Artifacts (Scholar: Crafting) Potions and Usables (Alchemy Mastery) Meals (Cooking) Buildings, Traps and non magical devices (Engineering)  Alchemy The brewing is a time consuming process. The process should be somehow deterministic so the results are logically to be obtained.\nOnce a receipt was discovered it is saved for the user so it can be reused very quickly. If a player repeatedly makes the same receipt the quality of the produced potions increases over time. The player can choose to write down the receipt and give it to other players who might increase their skill by reading it.\nCraft Duration Craft duration is determined by the item level which the player wants to craft. Skill points in the suitable skill tree (weapon, equipment, construction or alchemy, artifacts) reduces the build time. The baseDuration is given in real time minutes.\nbaseDuration = 28.8 * itemLevel Item and Entity Interactions It should be possible to link items to entities. Nesting should be possible. With this technique it is possible to combine active items.\nIts possible to do something like:\n Attaching or removing energy crystals to a magical artifact Boxes that can be stuffed with other items for shipping  For this purpose the items that can be stored in an entity must be limited. Filtering must be very flexible, be able to exclude certain items, be able to limit weight, etc. Each item also has its own resistance values. As soon as a Bestia is killed it will be checked if and if so how much damage individual items take. Even items lying on the ground can be damaged or even destroyed by attacks.\nDamaging of Items As with any item in Bestia, it can be damaged. There will be professions capable of repairing items. The durability of an item is given via a percentage. Items will function normally within a wide range of their condition. At a certain level, they slowly lose their properties (armor their armor value, weapons hit less often, magic staffs suffer a damage penalty, etc.). Until the items become unusable. If you then inflict further damage on them, they can be completely and irretrievably destroyed.\n   Durability State     30 - 100% Normal Operation   1 - 29% Increasing Damage Effects   0% Item breaks unrecoverably    Items on the ground can suffer damage from attacks. They are affected by Area Of Effect spells and can be targetted manually albeit they are not auto targeted like enemies.\nItem Status Values In order to let items participate in the battle system they need status values. Items status value distribution is based upon their type (weapon, potion, book etc) and the total amount of points to distribute is given by the item level. Later there might be items which get preset custom values but for now on they are based upon a lookup table.\nInventory The inventory is an important system for interaction between the player and the game mechanics. It must be easy to access and logical build. Each Bestia has its own inventory. So the player must be careful to exchange items between the Bestias in time. Trading must be fast to do to reduce the annoyance.\nIf a Bestia/Entity is killed and has had some items inside its inventory usually the items are dropped and can be looted. In case a player killed a mob the loot will be protected for 30 seconds so he can exclusivly loot it.\nWeight Limit Items weight is given by units of about 1kg per unit. The smallest division is 0.1 units which aproximates to 100gr. The maximum amount a Bestia can carry is dependent on its strength and its vitality. The Packhorse skill can increase the carriable weight limit. The formula is given as:\nlimit = STR / 2 + VIT / 5 + 15 + LEVEL / 10 Please not that depending of your used up weight limit regeneration of certain status values might be affected.\n"},{"idx":18,"href":"/docs/server/","title":"Server","content":" Bestia Server Star Watch\nThe basic server design relies on using Akka as the framework to form a so called cluster from multiple nodes. As soon as the cluster is formed the basic Bestia entities which represents all in game elements (player, things the player can interact with, buildings, enemies etc). The entities are distributed between the cluster nodes and so are the incoming player controls for these entities. If the system needs to scale up its easily possible to just spawn more cluster nodes to distribute the load.\nhttps://medium.com/@takezoe/save-state-of-actor-using-akka-persistence-a9111ff2c42b http://tudorzgureanu.com/akka-persistence-testing-persistent-actors/ http://blog.kamkor.me/Akka-Cluster-Load-Balancing/\nEntity Component Services Entities are described by dynamically attaching components to them. ECS system have been proven as a de facto industry standard for recent game development. The components only contain the data are attached to entities which merely are an ID in the system. The so called systems act upon this data and alter the entities usually this is the case in a fixed tick amount for game logic updates.. Since the bestia system is event based and not tick based we use a little different approach. We define services which work on entities and their components. These services are triggered by Akka Actors in case a event message arrives. This architecture is called entity component services and allows a better usage of computing resources in a clustered server environment.\nA entity factory will create a entity, save it into the memdb and also start a sharded entity into the cluster. The factory will also create and setup components which might have also active actors. If a component is created, altered or deleted these calls are intercepted via a configurable callback. Usually the component instances are cached for some amount of time to lessen the strain on the garbage collector. Upon creation of the component a message might get sent into the actorsystem to start up a component based actor which will then in turn control some execution specific operation like periodic health regeneration ticks.\nEntity Creators The first step into an usable entity are entity creators. They take alle domain data input or simple argument input and server as a helper function or a builder for usable a complete entities which are outfitted with components. They create the blueprints this is a building plan for the real entity factory for entity creation. The blueprints can either be created programmatically but they might also get statically described via JSON files which in turn then can be loaded by the software to create static entities (the created entities can of course later then be adjusted via scripts at runtime).\nBlueprint JSON Datenformat Blueprints are basically entity compositions described via JSON. Jackson is used to parse these files and feed them into a special BlueprintEntityFactory. The components are initialized with the values given in the blueprint.\nExample Dataformat { position: {x: 0, y: 0}, visible: {sprite: \u0026#39;name\u0026#39;, type: \u0026#39;type\u0026#39;}, script: {name: \u0026#39;bla\u0026#39;, type: \u0026#39;item\u0026#39;} }  Entity Actor System Bestia uses a entity actor system for management and active control of its entities. Each entity is registered via an in memory actor. When entity interact they communicate via the Akka messaging system. Components are child actors of an entity actor and they can send messages to other entities or components.\nEntity Resource Cleanup The inner world representation relies on entities with associated component data. The problem is in order to manage this entities in a message based way there must be also an active actor present to receive these messages and react accordingly. This actor capsules the logic of the entity but might also have child actors if certain components require them (like for example a script callback trigger actor which will trigger script callbacks in certain intervals). If components or entities are deleted not only should the object instance be reused, these resources must also be reliably cleaned up.\nInternal Messaging Akka messages should only be send from actors to actors. This keeps the messaging system away from the service structures thus allowing a clean separation of concerns. The main entry point of message digestion is the DigestExActor. Connection and authentication Client performs Authentication → Server accepts authentication → Webserver established connection → notifies client and server → server spawns client entities and updates client. Client Connection Actors hold the connection to the client and are used as a sharded actor. Updates to this certain client are sent to the sharded actor.\nComponent Synchronization Interest Management To optimize performance clients are divided into certain areas called area of interest (AOI). Only clients having a receive enabled entity (usually bestias) inside an AOI are receiving updates of what is happening around them. These receivable entities are realized via a component attached to a entity. All such entities enable players to receive updates. The update packets are marked with a flag from which entity the observation was done. The server needs to keep track which entities are within a certain interest zone. This is done directly via the x and y coordinates of an entity.\nAs soon as a transmittable Component changes the system automatically searchs for entities which needs an updated. The updated component is then transmitted to these entities or connected players.\n "},{"idx":19,"href":"/docs/server/scripts/","title":"Server Scripts","content":" Scripte Das Skript-System in Bestia wird genutzt um flexible Programmausführung für verschiedenste Zwecke zu ermöglichen. Dazu gehören vor allem die Effekte von benutzten Items, Attacken, das Verhalten von Gespawnten Entities usw.\nAls Skriptsprache wird auf JavaScript gesetzt, da diese sowieso im HTML Client verwendet werden muss und so eine weitere Sprache für das Spiel gespart werden kann. Aktuell wird die Nashorn Javascript Engine von Java 8 benutzt. Sollte sich dies als Performance Engpass herausstellen so kann später mit mittlerem Aufwand auf die V8 Engine von Google umgerüstet werden. Für alle Aktoren wird nur eine Script Engine verwendet. Da Javascripts von Natur her keine Mechanismen vorgesehen in einer Multithread Umgebung zu laufen, ist akribisch darauf zu achten, dass KEIN globaler State in den Scripten eingeführt und verwendet wird. Jede Ausführung muss einem zentralen Datenbestand arbeiten (Datenbank API). Zur Interaktion mit dem Bestia Server muss eine Script API vorgesehen werden, die den Scripten zusätzlich zu den von ihnen benötigten Variablen bei der Ausführung über ein Binding zur Verfügung gestellt wird.\nAllgemeine Fähigkeiten von Scripts  Scripts müssen Entities erzeugen oder zerstören können.

Usually the scripts get a exposed API which allows them to interact with the bestia system, alter or create new entities. Scripts are very powerful their code is called via entry point functions to perform specific tasks during runtime. Like for example trigger code execution if an item is equipped or an entity collides with a script collider. Yet these calls are for a direct interaction only. If scripts want to get notified for example when a certain event occurs we have to use the script callback event system. Other scripts can also emit certain events. Imagine we want to get notified for a weather event. We would do:\nBAPI.event.subscribe(‘weather.rain’, ‘global/script.js:onRain’);\nIn the rain script we would do a:\nBAPI.entity.find(rect(10, 10, 20, 20)).forEach(eid =\u0026gt; { var intensity = 0.6; BAPI.event.emit(‘weather.rain’, ‘start’, intensity); });\nIn order to set callbacks directly into functions one can use the setCallback API call with key: func:myFunc. This will invoke the function myFunc in the same script as it was called. With the key script:hello the top level of the script /script/hello.js will be called. And finally both keys can be combined: script:hello:func:test will invoke the function test inside the script /script/hello.js.\nSome special variable are always set for scripts. These variables vary from script to script type and are listed below. Global Variables SUID (string): Unique ID of the Script. Each script attached to an entity has its own unique id. The same script file attached to multiple entities has different UIDs. This id can be used to retrieve variables from the global storage. The UID is retained between successive calls from callbacks/timeouts for example. The script UID is currently only set if there is a permanent instance of a script. BAPI (Bestia API): API entry point which allows scripts to interact with the system. Script Entry Callbacks onCollision\nEquipment Scripts These are attached to equipments and are somehow similar to status effect scripts yet they share callbacks from items since equipments can lay down on the ground and there is a chance they get attacked.\nCallbacks  onAttach onDetach onDrop onPickup onTakeDamage  Item Scripts Item scripts are called if an item associated with the script is used. This is one of the most simple form of scripts.\nSpecial variables source (long, entity id): The owner who triggered the script target (long, entity id): Might be null. Is set if the item was intended to be used on a certain entity. targetPosition (Point): Might be null. Is set if the item was intended to be used on a certain place.\nAttack Scripts The attack scripts are a bit more complex. They are also simply called upon usage of an attack. Depending on the definition of the attack this might be the only place to perform certain damage calculation for example.\nInteract Scripts This scripts are called when interaction between an entity and a script takes place. The trigger can vary.\n"},{"idx":20,"href":"/docs/server/quests/","title":"Stories and Quests Generation","content":" Literature https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2016/09/02/how-to-procedurally-generate-culture/ http://www.gdcvault.com/play/1024143/Procedural-Narrative http://pcg.wikidot.com/pcg-algorithm:procedural-puzzles-and-plot-generation http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/5740836/\n"},{"idx":21,"href":"/docs/server/world-generation/","title":"World Generation","content":" World Generation Bestia uses a specialized library called worldgen for world creation.

Gehe zu 1.\nTemperaturkorrektur Temperaturgradient auf mT aufbringen. Versehe die Temperaturkarte mit einem Gradienten um am Aquator eine höhere Temperatur zu erhalten wie an den Polen (Nord, Süd).\nBiom Zuordnung TBD\nBiom Optimierung Nachdem die Biome über die Zuweisungsregeln hart zugewiesen wurden, müssen mehrere Plausibilitätsfilter verwendet werden um eine saubere Erzeugung zu gewährleisten.\nTBD: Welche Filter müssen hier angewendet werden? Was kann denn falsch erzeugt werden?\nErzeuge an den Biom Grenzen entsprechende Übergangsbiome.\nTilemap Zuordnung Jedes Biome besitzt ein gewisses Set an Tiles. Diese stammen aus einem oder mehreren Tilemaps (also eine Menge von GIDs). Zusätzlich existiert eine Reihe von weiteren Entities welche nach einer gewissen Wahrscheinlichkeit verteilt werden können (Bäume z.B.). Diese werden aber nicht immer einfach zufällig auf Koordianten platziert. Vielmehr kann es auch hier einen Top-Down Ansatz geben, der gewährleistet, dass eine ausreichend gute Verteilung der Features generiert wird.\nBiom Features Erzeuge entsprechende Strukturen innerhalb der Biome (siehe Tilemap Erzeugung). dazu gehört das Anlegen von Entities für Bäume, Pflanzen, hohes Gras, Steine, Felsen etc. Für jedes dieser Features existiert pro Biom eine oder mehrere Alternativen. Es gibt weiterhin eine Wahrscheinlichkeitsfunktion, die das Auftreten dieser Features innerhalb des Bioms regelt. Nach der Erzeugung werden alle Biome durchlaufen, diese Features so verteilt, dass ihre Positionierung innerhalb der bereits verteilten Tiles legal ist (keine Positionierung auf nicht begehbaren Felder etc.). Die Wahrscheinlichkeit für diese besonderen Orte ist in den Biomen gesteigert, bzw sie sind teilweise einzigartig für diese Biome. Folgende besondere Eigenschaften gelten für die verschiedenen Biome:\nEistundra  Alte Höhlensysteme\n Eistempel\n vermehrt Bodenschätze\n  Wälder  Alte Tempelanlagen\n Ruinen\n Alte, unbewohnte Dörfer\n Bewohnte Siedlungen\n Höhlen\n Grabstädten\n  Cities Cities usually form around natural resources like shores, rivers or rich farmland. The algorithm as described below will find suitable city position candidates and then distribute the cities in 2 to n clusters around the world map. This clustering will make sure there is enough unexplored land for the players left. It should also help with the idea of different civilization which could lead to ingame player conflicts. A possible distribution is shown in here.

Aufbauen auf der Weltkarte wird eine Influence Map erstellt. Wasserwege geben einen abfallenden Wert vor. Die Auflösung der Influence Map kann geringer sein als die eigentliche Karte. Auflösungen zwischen 100m und 1km erscheinen praktikabel. Folgende Punkte werden auf der Influence Map vergeben und summiert:\n Ist das Biom praktisch um Lebensmittel anzubauen? Sind natürliche Ressourcen in diesem Biom vorhanden? Wasser Biom in der Nähe gibt Punkte.  Von der Influence Map müssen nun die Punkte entfernt werden die eindeutig keine Besiedlung ermöglichen. Folgende Punkte müssen auf 0 reduziert werden:\n Liegen im Wasser/Lava Liegen auf Gebirge Liegen im Wald Liegen in Gebieten mit sehr hoher Magie  Bei allen verbleibenden Punkten muss überprüft werden ob es sich um ein lokales Maximum handelt. Diese Punkte werden zusammen mit ihrer Gewichtung in eine sortierte Liste aufgenommen. Dabei kann ein wandernder Durchschnitt berechnet werden und Werte unterhalb eines gewissen Schwellwertes verworfen werden.\nKoordinaten die dann zu nahe beieinander liegen (\u0026lt; 3-6km) werden aus der Liste entfernt.\nAnhand der Punkte auf der Liste werden die Siedlungen berechnet. Zu 70% wird eine Stadt aus der oberen Hälfte der Liste der Reihe nach entnommen. Zu 30% wird eine Siedlung zufällig aus einem Kandidaten der unteren Listenhälfte entnommen bis die Anzahl der gewünschten Siedlungen erreicht ist oder die Liste erschöpft ist. Sollte ein Listenteil erschöpft sein, so wird jeweils vom anderen Listenteil mit dem gleichen Muster vorgegangen.\nErzeugung von Städten\n Bestimmung der Anzahl der Gebäude anhand der Populationsmenge.

Zum Nutzen und Verwendung der einzelnen Bodenschätze, siehe Abschnitt Ressourcen.\nRoads Weltzerstörung Die Welt soll durch das Herbeiführen von Rift Events strukturell geschwächt werden, bis sie mit einer weiteren Welt kollidiert. Die Spieler selbst bleiben bei solch einem Event relativ unbeschadet. Je nach Fraktion/Kult welcher die Spieler angehören wird es aber weitreichende Mali oder Boni geben. In der neu generierten Welt starten die Spieler wieder zunächst ohne Kult Zugehörigkeit.\n"}];window.bookSearch={pages:pages,idx:lunr(function(){this.ref("idx");this.field("title");this.field("content");pages.forEach(this.add,this);}),}})();
