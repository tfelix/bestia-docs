      <description>Attacks The magic and the usage of it plays a crucial role in the Bestia universe. The users should be able to be deeply involved into magic spell creation and research.
 The words Attacks and Spells are equally used.
 The system must allow the user to describe or discover newly innovative ways to combine spells. Yet the research should be fun and entertaining. Bestias can learn attacks by two means:</description>

      <description>Resources Resources are raw materials used to sell to other players. They can be used to craft items or construct buildings. Resources can be obtained by the following means:
 Killing enemies and loot them Gathering of natural resources in the game world Using special extracting buildings or devices Recycling of existing items   The item loot from monster should be logically correct: a dead wolve would very likly not drop iron ore or golden coins.</description>

      <description>Client Architecture Entities The Bestia server entities are synced to the client also represented there also under the name Entities. An entity is described by a set of components which is attached to it and by a certain kind of logic synched between the client and the server. Not every component is synched though. This can depend on various factors for example party membership (ConditionComponent is only synched between members of the same party), or ownership or view distance (mostly only entities in view distance are synched).</description>

      <description>Status Values Status Values are the base values from which the basics for all ingame calculations are performed. There are four main types of values: Base Values, Status Valus, Condition Values and Effort Values. The Status Based Values (SBV) play a special role.
The sophisticated status system describes the current state of an bestia (or simply any living entity) and does not strictly apply only to biological entities. The status system is important to calculate all battle related effects in the game.</description>

      <description>Server Architecture Entity Component Services Entities are described by dynamically attaching components to them. ECS system have been proven as a de facto industry standard for recent game development. The components only contain the data are attached to entities which merely are an ID in the system. The so called systems act upon this data and alter the entities usually this is the case in a fixed tick amount for game logic updates.</description>

      <description>Battle system The battle or attack is performed in various stages. Equipments or Status effects either alter the DamageVars or expose certain hooks which are called during the damage calculation. In the case of the DamageVars this object is
The attack itself either provides a script to completely manage the effect which takes place during cast or it provides certain callbacks for damage calculation stages which are getting called while applying the damage.</description>

      <description>Quests The game will be more or less an Open World game. But the declared goal will be to try out new ways of storytelling in order to present a credible world with developing history to the players. You have to say goodbye to the idea that every game can live through every part of the story/quest. This contradicts the persistent and inner logical structure of the game world. Quests must rather result dynamically from what happens within the game world.</description>

      <description>Scripting Das Skript-System in Bestia wird genutzt um flexible Programmausführung für verschiedenste Zwecke zu ermöglichen. Dazu gehören vor allem die Effekte von benutzten Items, Attacken, das Verhalten von Entities zu steuern.
Als Skriptsprache wird auf JavaScript gesetzt. Aktuell wird die Nashorn Javascript Engine von Java 8 benutzt. Sollte sich dies als Performance Engpass herausstellen so kann später mit mittlerem Aufwand auf die V8 Engine von Google umgerüstet werden. Für alle Aktoren wird nur eine Script Engine verwendet.</description>

      <description>World Generation Bestia integrates a specialized library called WorldGen for world creation. It is a clusterable generator which is cabable of dividing the world creation workload onto multiple, different machines. With this framework it should be possible to create million of square kilometers without hitting any memory limit on the servers during the creation process.
In general it works by creating piplines which are then used to create and transform noise maps.</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence The AI system in Bestia will set new standards. Bestias and NPCs alike should be able to create long-term plans, so-called game plans or GPs for short. They then follow this strategy until observations or influences from the game world force them to abandon this plan or the plan is fulfilled.
Bestias look for ways to get the highest possible inner happiness. They must sleep, eat and feel attracted to mana currents.</description>

      <description>Bestia Master The intro game tells players how to become a Bestia Master. They came into direct contact with an ephemeral mana crystal that changed their nature through magic and connected them to the mana flows. They are therefore receptive to the influence of mana and are able to communicate with the beings that emerge from this mythical energy: the Bestias.
The attachment to mana also explains why Bestia masters were able to survive the destruction of their world relatively unscathed and to pass on to the next world.</description>

      <description>Bestias In areas with high mana concentration, so-called mini rift events are formed. At these neuralgic points, Bestia are materialized and enter the respective worlds. They are basically automatically spawning on the map with a higher probability where the mana concentration is higher.
The type of the Bestia which spawns is determined by the environments (Bestias have a affinity to certain biomes and they spawn according to this probability in the different biomes).</description>

      <description>Environment Bestia uses a sophisticated temperature and environment system to drive weather simulation and the effects on the players environment.
These simulations should be based on certain basic values which are determined location-dependent, but can be changed by interaction with the players. Also natural changes through the world (seasons) should lead to an adjustment of these values. Due to the changes of the environmental values tiles have to be adapted to the world itself.</description>

      <description>Items Items can be optained by the player and carried around. The amount of items limited to each entity is determined via its Inventory. Each Bestia (and also a lot of other entities), have their own inventory with different sizes.
Items are mostly crafted by the players. Its quite rare to obtain direct item drops from killed enemies. Instead its very common to loot resources when enemies are killed.
Each item has a level assigned.</description>
