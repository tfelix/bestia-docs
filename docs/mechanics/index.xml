      <description>Resources Resources are raw materials used to sell to other players. They can be used to craft items or construct buildings. Resources can be obtained by the following means:
 Killing enemies and loot them Gathering of natural resources in the game world Using special extracting buildings or devices Recycling of existing items   The item loot from monster should be somewhat logcal: a dead wolve would very likly not drop iron ore or golden coins.</description>

      <description>Attacks The magic and the usage of it plays a crucial role in the Bestia universe. The users should be able to be deeply involved into magic spell creation and research.
 There is a difference between the Master Skills and the attacks/skills of a Bestia: The master skills are based on a skill tree while the attacks of a Bestia are learned automatically when reaching the designated level.
 The system must allow the user to describe or discover newly innovative ways to combine spells.</description>

      <description>Status Values Status Values are the base values from which the basics for all ingame calculations are performed. There are four main types of values: Base Values, Status Valus, Condition Values and Effort Values. The Status Based Values (SBV) play a special role.
The sophisticated status system describes the current state of an bestia (or simply any living entity) and does not strictly apply only to biological entities. The status system is important to calculate all battle related effects in the game.</description>

      <description>Bestia Master The intro game tells players how to become a Bestia Master. They came into direct contact with an ephemeral mana crystal that changed their nature through magic and connected them to the mana flows. They are therefore receptive to the influence of mana and are able to communicate with the beings that emerge from this mythical energy: the Bestias.
The attachment to mana also explains why Bestia masters were able to survive the destruction of their world relatively unscathed and to pass on to the next world.</description>

      <description>Bestias In areas with high mana concentration, so-called mini rift events are formed. At these neuralgic points, Bestia are materialized and enter the respective worlds. They are basically automatically spawning on the map with a higher probability where the mana concentration is higher.
The type of the Bestia which spawns is determined by the environments (Bestias have a affinity to certain biomes and they spawn according to this probability in the different biomes).</description>

      <description>Environment Bestia uses a sophisticated temperature and environment system to drive weather simulation and the effects on the players environment.
These simulations should be based on certain basic values which are determined location-dependent, but can be changed by interaction with the players. Also natural changes through the world (seasons) should lead to an adjustment of these values. Due to the changes of the environmental values tiles have to be adapted to the world itself.</description>

      <description>Items Items can be optained by the player and carried around. The amount of items limited to each entity is determined via its Inventory. Each Bestia (and also a lot of other entities), have their own inventory with different sizes.
Items are mostly crafted by the players. Its quite rare to obtain direct item drops from killed enemies. Instead its very common to loot resources when enemies are killed.
Each item has a level assigned.</description>
