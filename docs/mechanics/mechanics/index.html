<p>The main story revolves around the player whose world was destroyed due to a so-called <strong>Rift Event</strong>. The magic pushed into his world and merged it with another one. This altered the physical properties of both worlds and mostly destroyed them in the process.</p>
<p>The player is thrown into a new world and must learn to survive on his own (while exploring the new world, gathering resources, making friends and foes).</p>
<p>The principle of destroying the world is the common thread throughout the game. By joining one of the different cults the players can actively work towards a destruction of the world or preventing it from harm (see 
  <a href="/#cults">The Cults</a> for more information).</p>
<p>Due to this event the world is <strong>generated dynamically</strong>. Despite the ultimate goal of the game to prevent or initiate this destruction, this should remain a rare event that occurs no more frequently than every 1 to 2 years (in real time). The newly generated world should cover as wide a spectrum of biomes as possible. The world and its inhabitants embed themselves in a certain history, which should also be generated as automatically as possible. This enriches the player experience especially in the beginning when there are not many players.</p>
<p>For the details of world generation, see the 
  <a href="/docs/server/world-generation/">server documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="postal-system">Postal System</h2>
<p>Based on World of Warcraft, a postal system is to be established. The system should make it possible to send letters,
but above all items and money to other players and places. And is also important for the 
  <a href="/#player-quests">player quest system</a> as mostly quest rewards will need to be delived via a postal system).</p>
<p>Like the rest of the game this should be solved by an ingame system. There should be NPCs which will take care of delivering postal services and players should setup Bestias in order to perform this delivery. This can be a quest on its own. If there is no player taking care in time for this delivery there should be always an NPC showing up taking care of the delivery, then the reward is lost.</p>
<p>The postal fee is defined by:</p>

<link rel="stylesheet" href="/katex/katex.min.css" />
<script defer src="/katex/katex.min.js"></script>
<script defer src="/katex/auto-render.min.js" onload="renderMathInElement(document.body);"></script><span>
  \[   price =  0.01g \cdot km \cdot m_{kg}\\
   deliver_{time} =  8h &#43; km / 10\]
</span>

<p>The player can decide to insure his delivery which will setup a teleport spell on the item if its not looted but the postman is killed which will deliver it towards the target destination. But this will take another 0.5-1 days in real time before the item will then be available at the target location.</p>
<p>Gold and text-only messages can be send via a special telegram system which is very hard to intercept. But the fee is 3 times the usual price (but gold has no ingame weight, so you are allowed to carry as much as you want).</p>
<h3 id="the-cults">The Cults</h3>
<p>In each Bestia World there are 2 cults to which the Bestia summoners can belong. When creating the world. One cult should aim for the destruction of the world, the other should prevent it.</p>
<p>The cults are ultimately a faction. The goal is to be able to play these factions among themselves. Usually players can fight against each other at any time, but the rivalries should take place between the cults. To this end, game mechanics must be established that in a certain way grant the individual cults an additional bonus in a collaborative approach and thus offer playful incentives to actively intervene in the game.</p>
<p>Players can invest into their cults citadelle. Only one citadel can exist at the time but players are free to build as many temples as they want, where they can access the services of their cult. The interesting thing is that some of the archivements by the cults will remain active when the world is replaced by a new one. So these cults help a lot when players want to keep their wealth during a world destruction event.</p>
<p>Players should be able to change cults. However, this will be sanctioned with a difficult task and will be associated with various disadvantages.</p>
<h4 id="citadels-and-temples">Citadels and Temples</h4>
<p>The order can research powerful spells and devices which the players can then learn or access to accomplish their goal.</p>
<h4 id="the-chaos">The Chaos</h4>
<p>The Chaos tries to inflict destruction and to speed up the worlds downfall, as they believe the mana influx is the fate every world must face finally. They try to mass the amount of mana, open rifts in remote legions to form the world after their twisted image until it goes down in flames.</p>
<h4 id="the-order">The Order</h4>
<p>This cult is the preserving one. They belive in stability and try to stop the ongoing destruction of the worlds. Their ultimate goal is to bring an end to the influx of mana. Thus they research a lot of spells to remove and control the mana influx and rifts.</p>
<h4 id="cult-advantages">Cult Advantages</h4>
<p>It would be conceivable that special land areas fall under the influence of a certain cult. This would attract certain Bestias that are friendly to the cult members. Special resources are generated or more Mana rifts are opened and the Mana within the country increases there. Furthermore, the prevailing faction can be rewarded with a global bonus.</p>
<p>When a world is created it is assumed it will last for <span>
  \(x\)
</span>
 days. If the Chaos manages to destroy a world in <code>80%</code> of this time we interpret this as an cult advantage <span>
  \(ca\)
</span>
 of <code>20%</code>, likewise if the Order keeps a world alive for <code>130%</code> of its estimated time their <span>
  \(ca\)
</span>
 is <code>30%</code>.</p>

<p>The boni are not yet fully designed, feel free to make suggestions.</p>

<h3 id="auction-house">Auction House</h3>
<p>Trading is an important mechanic and allows player to exchange goods as the whole Bestia economy is player driven. Players can create auction hauses which can be used in order to perform trades while they are offline themselves.</p>
<p>If an auction house was build by a player or a guild no other auction house can be build in a 300m radius. The player can decide the auction fee between 1% - 10% for new auctions. This fee is collected in the auction house and must be collected by the owners. Players can then use the auction house to sell their items by listing them. Either they set them up for a fixed price of do an auction. The decide between 1 (80% fee), 2 (100% fee), 3 (120% fee) or 5 (140% fee) days length for the auction.</p>
<p>Auction houses of different owners can be linked in order to display the shared auctions. If a player wins an auction the item is delivered via postal service to the player if he decides to pay the delivery fee. The item is then send via the regular postal service from the linked auction house.</p>
<p>If the player does not pay the fee the item is withheld for him up to 10 days until it is returned to his owner (who can keep the price payed for the item from the player who did not collect his item).</p>
<h3 id="currency">Currency</h3>
<p>All the ingame currency is made from gold found by the players. Yes you have heard it right the players must harvest gold deposites in order to make their own money. Gold can directly be turned into gold coins.</p>
<p>In order to start the economy the NPC have 10% of the available world wealth in gold. This wealth is re-distributed equally between every NPC every night. This mechanic is one of the few that have no underlying real world logic.</p>
<h3 id="honor">Honor</h3>
<p>It is possible in Bestia to perform malicious actions which will reduce the players good experience. This is by design!
Yet there should be incentives for players not to go this route in order to protect low level players from ganking of
other griev play. If a player behaves well and their honor level increases they will get more and more rewards. On the
other hand if a player has negative honor they will get bad reputation and repressions. There might actually be some
player initiated hunt on these low honor players.</p>
<p>Additionally each NPC maintains an internal list of reputation points and players. If a player misbehaves or behaves in
a friendly way, this list will be adjusted. The NPC also communicates this list with other NPCs if they meet. If the reputation
exceeds certain upper and lower limits and the NPC enters areas that use a long-distance communication system, the NPC
may also communicate this to more distant areas. Only if the players reputation falls below -100 the NPC encountered
(and acted negative towards them) they remembers this permanently. Higher values slowly return to the default value
of 0 and are then removed from the list (NPCs don&rsquo;t forget if a player killed family members or the NPC life was saved).
If the customer reaches the nearest settlement via the reputation points after a certain time, the value is also stored
there permanently.</p>
<p>Reputation decreases faster through bad deeds than increasing because of good ones.</p>
<h4 id="protected-zones">Protected Zones</h4>
<p>Around the starting places there will be a enchantment in place which will mark the lands in the vacinity as <strong>Protected Zones</strong>.
Inside this zone every kill of another player Bestia with more then 5 levels less as the killing bestia
or NPC will reduce the honor by <strong>20 points</strong>.</p>
<p>Every action which leads to honor loss inside a protected zone (other then killing a low level Player Bestia) will be <strong>multiplied by 3</strong>
wheras honor increasing actions will be <strong>multiplied by 1.5</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="negative-honor">Negative Honor</h4>
<p>As there are multiple factions which different interests it is not easy to define which play is considered bad behavior
which will get punished automatically. Yet there are some core actions which will be universally be considered as griev play
which is not inherently forbidden but will result in a loss of honor.</p>
<p>If a player drops below 0 honor he will receive the debuff <strong>Rogue</strong>. If a player has less then -100 honor he will receive
the debuff <strong>Outlaw</strong>.</p>
<p>If the honor drops below 0 the negative effects will start to take place. The effects are as follows:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Honor Amount</th>
<th>Effect</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt; 0</td>
<td>No more advantages from NPC and the NPC will act unfriendly against the player.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt; -50</td>
<td>Some NPC might start to act hostile and attack the player or flee from him.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt; -100</td>
<td>NPC will permanently remember the player and also spread the word around so more NPC will start to act hostile towards the player.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>If a player steals something not belonging to him but to a NPC or another player he will loose honor for each item he takes and depending on the item level. Stealing means if a player picks up an item from a storage space not belonging to him. The owner can also grant certain player access right to a chest, in this case removal of items is not considered a stealing act.</p>
<p>A player who steals an item is also marked with the debuff *<strong>Thief</strong> which will grant any player who kills him <strong>5 extra honor</strong>. The killing player also gets a honor reward for each item returned to the original owner of the items within 6 real time hours (18 hours in Bestia time).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Looting a dead NPC/player however, will not lead to a reduction of honor.</p>

<h4 id="positive-honor">Positive Honor</h4>
<p>A positive honor level will lead to very friendly NPC which might even give the player some discounts or gifts from time to time. In order to increase your honor level again you can:</p>
<ul>
<li>Kill a player with negative honor, which is indicated by certain debuffs visible to other players</li>
<li>Helping a NPC by healing or resurrecting a dead NPC</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="shrines-of-judgement">Shrines of Judgement</h4>
<p>There are a 5 shrines in each game world incarnation where a player can sacrifice to raise a reputation that has fallen below the threshold of a player&rsquo;s global persecution. The sacrifice is usually (depending on the reputation threshold) very painful and even if it was made it can take several days until the news about it was spread.</p>
