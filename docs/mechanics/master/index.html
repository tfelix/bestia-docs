<h1 id="bestia-master">Bestia Master</h1>

<p>The intro game tells players how to become a Bestia Master. They came into direct contact with an ephemeral mana crystal
that changed their nature through magic and connected them to the mana flows. They are therefore receptive to the
influence of mana and are able to communicate with the beings that emerge from this mythical energy: <strong>the Bestias</strong>.</p>

<p>The attachment to mana also explains why Bestia masters were able to survive the destruction of their world relatively
unscathed and to pass on to the next world.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Bestia Master enter the current world from another, not further mentioned dimension. During each incarnation
a name of this world is generated and in each cycle all Bestia Master entering the game will have this world name
persisted in their account data to keep a record.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="skill-mastery">Skill Mastery</h2>

<p>The bestia master of a player can learn a set of skills. Since these skills are bound to the account they are called
account skills or just skills. These skills are freely chosen by the player and determine the job or profession of
the master.</p>

<p>Some of this account skills can be used by every Bestia in posession others only by the master itself.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Don&rsquo;t confuse this skills with the regular attacks a Bestia is learning by item usage or level up. These are simply
called <a href="/docs/mechanics/attacks">attacks</a>.</p>
</blockquote>

<h3 id="guidlines">Guidlines</h3>

<ul>
<li>The number of total skil ranks inside a tree should <strong>be between 70-80</strong></li>
<li>The possible rank counts of a skill should be: <strong>1, 5 and 10</strong></li>
<li>There should be some meaningful dependency of the skills forming an exciting tree</li>
<li>In each profession tree there should form 2-3 sub-trees which create a miningful hierarchy</li>
<li>There should be some kind of three tiers inside a tree form low and basic skill to the much powerfull skills</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
<p>Most Important: No Hardcoded Skill Effects!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skills should be used when possible require some interaction with the player whose success depends on the effect of the
skill. An example would be the teleport ability: after selecting the players (which can be flexible by the number) and
the magic interference at the destination, the player must win a small mini-game in the client which can be a skill
game. Depending on how successful this was, the player will be more precisely transported to the destination.</p>

<p>Ultimately, it remains important to leave the outcome of skills open in some way. However, the result should remain
understandable and influenceable by the player.</p>

<h3 id="skill-progression">Skill Progression</h3>

<p>Upon each level up the master gains 1 skillpoint to put into the skills rank. This is permanent and means a player can
spend about 100 points for improving the ranks of his skills.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Since max level is not capped actually he might be able to spend more points but a progressions gets continously
harder it is safe to assume every player has about 100 points.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The skilltrees are designed as such that to reach the highest professions in a tree the player needs to spend <strong>70 points</strong>.</p>

<p>The player can decide to have mediocre profession in each tree or to max out one and have maybe half of the
meaningful professions of another tree. The skilltree is a hierarchical dependency of skills.</p>

<h3 id="common-tree">Common Tree</h3>

<p>In this tree, simple, common mundane tasks are placed.</p>

<h3 id="first-aid">First Aid</h3>

<h3 id="cooking-5">Cooking (5)</h3>

<h3 id="fishing-5">Fishing (5)</h3>

<h2 id="battle-tree">Battle Tree</h2>

<p>The battle tree contains skills which are primarly useful for fighting, battle and maybe to some extend improve survival
 in the wild.</p>

<h1 id="honor">Honor</h1>

<p>It is possible in Bestia to perform malicious actions which will reduce the players good experience. This is by design!
Yet there should be incentives for players not to go this route in order to protect low level players from ganking of
other griev play. If a player behaves well and their honor level increases they will get more and more rewards. On the
other hand if a player has negative honor they will get bad reputation and repressions. There might actually be some
player initiated hunt on these low honor players.</p>

<p>Additionally each NPC maintains an internal list of reputation points and players. If a player misbehaves or behaves in
a friendly way, this list will be adjusted. The NPC also communicates this list with other NPCs if they meet. If the reputation
exceeds certain upper and lower limits and the NPC enters areas that use a long-distance communication system, the NPC
may also communicate this to more distant areas. Only if the players reputation falls below -100 the NPC encountered
(and acted negative towards them) they remembers this permanently. Higher values slowly return to the default value
of 0 and are then removed from the list (NPCs don&rsquo;t forget if a player killed family members or the NPC life was saved).
If the customer reaches the nearest settlement via the reputation points after a certain time, the value is also stored
there permanently.</p>

<p>Reputation decreases faster through bad deeds than increasing because of good ones.</p>

<h2 id="protected-zones">Protected Zones</h2>

<p>Around the starting places there will be a enchantment in place which will mark the lands in the vacinity as <strong>Protected Zones</strong>.
Inside this zone every kill of another player Bestia with more then 5 levels less as the killing bestia
or NPC will reduce the honor by <strong>20 points</strong>.</p>

<p>Every action which leads to honor loss inside a protected zone (other then killing a low level Player Bestia) will be <strong>multiplied by 3</strong>
wheras honor increasing actions will be <strong>multiplied by 1.5</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="negative-honor">Negative Honor</h2>

<p>As there are multiple factions which different interests it is not easy to define which play is considered bad behavior
which will get punished automatically. Yet there are some core actions which will be universally be considered as griev play
which is not inherently forbidden but will result in a loss of honor.</p>

<p>If a player drops below 0 honor he will receive the debuff <a href="/">Rogue</a>. If a player has less then -100 honor he will receive
the debuff <a href="/">Outlaw</a>.</p>

<h3 id="stealing">Stealing</h3>

<p>Stealing means if a player picks up an item from a storage chest not belonging to him. The owner can also grant certain player
access right to a chest. Then its not considered stealing. A guild leader can also mark storage chests as usable for guild members.</p>

<p>A player who steals an item is also marked with the debuff <a href="/">Thief</a> which will grant any player who kills him <strong>5 extra honor</strong>. The killing
player also gets a honor reward for each item returned to the original owner of the items within 6 real time hours (18 hours in Bestia time).</p>

<tr>
<td>&lt; 0</td>
<td>No more advantages from NPC and the NPC will act unfriendly against the player.</td>

</tr>

<tr>
<td>&lt; -100</td>
<td>NPC will permanently remember the player and also spread the word around so more NPC will start to act hostile towards the player.</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

<p>If a player steals something not belonging to him but to a NPC or another player he will loose honor for each item he
takes and depending on the <a href="/mechanics/items/#item-level">item level</a> (looting a dead NPC/player will not lead to a
reduction of honor).</p>

<h2 id="positive-honor">Positive Honor</h2>

<p>A positive honor level will lead to very friendly NPC which might even give the player some discounts or gifts from
time to time. In order to increase your honor level again you can:</p>

<ul>
<li>Kill a player with negative honor</li>
<li>Helping a NPC by healing or resurrecting a dead NPC</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="shrines-of-judgement">Shrines of Judgement</h3>

<p>There are a 5 shrines in each game world incarnation where a player can sacrifice to raise a reputation that has fallen below the threshold of a player&rsquo;s global
persecution. The sacrifice is usually (depending on the reputation threshold) very painful and even if it was made it can take
several days until the news about it was spread.</p>
