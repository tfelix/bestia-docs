      <description>Server Architecture Bestia uses a entity actor system for management and active control of its entities. Each entity is registered via an in memory actor. When entity interact they communicate via the Akka messaging system. Components are child actors of an entity actor and they can send messages to other entities or components.
Entity Component Services Entities are described by dynamically attaching components to them. ECS system have been proven as a de facto industry standard for recent game development.</description>

      <description>Battle System The battle system is quite complex to allow almost any entity to get damaged in the game. Usually a battle context is established before damage calculation takes place. The attack is performed in various stages. Equipments or status effects either alter the DamageVars or expose certain hooks which are called during the damage calculation.
The attack itself either provides a script to completely manage the effect which takes place during cast or it provides certain callbacks for damage calculation stages which are getting called while applying the damage.</description>

      <description>Quests The game will be more or less an Open World game. But the declared goal will be to try out new ways of storytelling in order to present a credible world with developing history to the players. You have to say goodbye to the idea that every game can live through every part of the story/quest. This contradicts the persistent and inner logical structure of the game world. Quests must rather result dynamically from what happens within the game world.</description>

      <description>Scripting Das Skript-System in Bestia wird genutzt um flexible Programmausführung für verschiedenste Zwecke zu ermöglichen. Dazu gehören vor allem die Effekte von benutzten Items, Attacken, das Verhalten von Entities zu steuern.
The scripting language used is JavaScript. The scripting language is used to allow fast iteration and changes to the items. There is an API provided for the scripts in order to interact with the entity system of Bestia.
Script code must always be placed inside a main() function.</description>

      <description>World Generation Bestia integrates a specialized library called WorldGen for world creation. It is a clusterable generator which is cabable of dividing the world creation workload onto multiple, different machines. With this framework it should be possible to create million of square kilometers without hitting any memory limit on the servers during the creation process.
In general it works by creating piplines which are then used to create and transform noise maps.</description>

      <description>Artificial Intelligence The AI system in Bestia will set new standards. Bestias and NPCs alike should be able to create long-term plans, so-called game plans or GPs for short. They then follow this strategy until observations or influences from the game world force them to abandon this plan or the plan is fulfilled.
Bestias look for ways to get the highest possible inner happiness. They must sleep, eat and feel attracted to mana currents.</description>
